Image by Nick Youngson You have a string s and you may modify it by making long swaps of its letters. Two letters can be swapped if their positions differ by at least k. That is, you may swap the i-th letter with the j-th letter in s if |i - j| geq k. Is it possible to sort all the letters in s increasingly, if you are allowed to swap any number of times (possibly zero)? Input The first line has a string s (2 leq |s| leq 100) and an integer k (1 leq k leq |s| - 1), separated by a single space. The string s consists of only lowercase letters. Output If it is possible to sort the letters increasingly, output “Yes”. Otherwise output “No”. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 prognova 4 Yes Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 helloworld 6 No
