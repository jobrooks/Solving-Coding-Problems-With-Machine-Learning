A smallest different sequence (SDS) is a sequence of positive integers created as follows: A_1=r geq 1. For n>1, A_ n=A_{n-1}+d, where d is the smallest positive integer not yet appearing as a value in the sequence or as a difference between two values already in the sequence. For example, if A_1 =1, then since 2 is the smallest number not in our sequence so far, A_2=A_1+2=3. Likewise A_3=7, since 1, 2 and 3 are already accounted for, either as values in the sequence, or as a difference between two values. Continuing, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 accounted for, leaving 5 as our next smallest difference; thus A_4=12. The next few values in this SDS are 20, 30, 44, 59, 75, 96, ldots  For a positive integer m, you are to determine where in the SDS m first appears, either as a value in the SDS or as a difference between two values in the SDS. In the above SDS, 12, 5, 9 and 11 first appear in step 4. Input Input consists of a single line containing two positive integers A_1 m (1 leq r leq 100, 1 leq m leq 200, 000, 000). Output Display the smallest value n such that the sequence A_1, ldots , A_ n either contains m as a value in the sequence or as a difference between two values in the sequence. All answers will be leq 10, 000. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 5 4 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 1 12 4 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 5 1 2
