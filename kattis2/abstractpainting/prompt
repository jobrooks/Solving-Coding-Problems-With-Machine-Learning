Gon is currently training to become a modern artist. Abstract Painting. Everyday, Gon practices his painting skill on a rectangular canvas, divided into R cdot C unit squares, with R rows and C columns. Gon wants to paint all the edges of all unit squares. Contrary to popular belief, creating a good modern painting is not an easy task. A good modern painting should use a limited number of colors, simple yet elegant. Thus, when creating his painting, Gon strictly adheres to the following rules: Only 3 colors are used: Red, Green and Blue. All edges of all unit squares must be painted. Each edge must be painted with exactly one color. For each unit square, exactly 2 colors must be used to paint its 4 edges. Furthermore, each color must be used to paint exactly 2 edges. In the following figure: The painting on the left is a good painting. The painting on the right is not a good painting, because the top-left unit square has 3 blue edges. Now Gon is wondering, how many different good paintings are there? Two paintings, both with R rows and C columns, are considered different, if there exists one edge painted with different colors in the two paintings. Please help Gon! Input The first line contains exactly one integer T — the number of test cases (1 le T le 5). T lines follow, each line contains exactly two integers R and C (1 le R le 14, 1 le C le 2, 000). Output Output exactly T lines, each line contains a single integer — the number of different good paintings, modulo 10^{9} + 7. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 1 1 1 2 2 1 18 108 108
