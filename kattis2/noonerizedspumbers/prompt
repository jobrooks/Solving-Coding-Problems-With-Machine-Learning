Everyone has heard of spoonerisms, named after William Archibald Spooner, an Oxford professor who had a habit of swapping prefixes of words, often with comical results. “May I show you to your seat?” became “May I sew you to your sheet?” and “a crushing blow” became “a blushing crow.” Just imagine him as a student of arithmetic, occasionally swapping the prefixes of the numbers he was calculating with and then wondering why his equations never made any sense. For instance, when he writes: what he really intended to write was: (He swapped prefixes “9” and “669” in the first and third numbers.) And when he writes: what he really intended to write was: (He swapped the prefix “72” with the prefix “68” in the first and second numbers.) Grading homework from young Mr. Spooner is quite a challenge. Fleas pined a way to help! Input The input consists of a single line containing an expression of the form “x + y = z” or “x * y = z”, where x, y, and z are positive integers less than 2^{31}. There will be single spaces surrounding the “+” and “*” operators and the “=” sign. The expression will not be a mathematically correct equation. Output Output a mathematically correct equation consisting of the input line modified by swapping proper prefixes of two of the three numbers x, y, z. (A proper prefix of a string s is a prefix that is neither empty nor equal to s.) Separate the numbers, operators, and the “=” sign with single spaces. All integers in the correct equation will be non-negative and less than 2^{31}. There is guaranteed to be only one possible correct equation that can be formed by swapping proper prefixes. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 92 + 2803 = 669495 6692 + 2803 = 9495 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 6891 * 723 = 4979753 7291 * 683 = 4979753
