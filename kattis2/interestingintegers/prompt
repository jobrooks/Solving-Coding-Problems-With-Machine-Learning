This results in the sequence 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,ldots . Now let us consider more generally sequences that obey the same recursion relation\begin{equation*} G_ i = G_{i-1} + G_{i-2} \qquad \text {for } i>2 \end{equation*} but start with two numbers G_1 leq G_2 of our own choice. We shall call these Gabonacci sequences. For example, if one uses G_1=1 and G_2=3, one gets what are known as the Lucas numbers: 1,3,4,7,11,18,29,ldots . These numbers are – apart from 1 and 3 – different from the Fibonacci numbers. By choosing the first two numbers appropriately, you can get any number you like to appear in the Gabonacci sequence. For example, the number n appears in the sequence that starts with 1 and n-1, but that is a bit lame. It would be more fun to start with numbers that are as small as possible, would you not agree? Input On the first line one positive number: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case: one line with a single integer n (2 leq n leq 10^9): the number to appear in the sequence. Output Per test case: one line with two integers a and b (0 < a leq b), such that, for G_1=a and G_2=b, G_ k = n for some k. These numbers should be the smallest possible, i.e., there should be no numbers a’ and b’ with the same property, for which b’<b, or for which b’=b and a’<a.
