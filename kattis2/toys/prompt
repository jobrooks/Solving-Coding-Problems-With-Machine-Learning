Little Lark has a great collection of of toys. Although she has plenty of toys she only likes to play with one at a time. She decides which toy to play with by placing all the toys in a circle around her, numbering them 0 to T-1. She then spins around in the clockwise direction and removes every Kth toy until one remains. This means that the first toy that she removes is numbered K-1. If any toys are moved during this ritual Lark will start crying and then rearrange the toys in the circle in the original order. Today Lark wants her father to join her while playing with the toys. Her father has of course a favorite toy among Larkâ€™s selection of toys and would of course like that specific toy to be chosen.
