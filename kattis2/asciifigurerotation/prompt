Consider an ASCII art figure like the one on the left. If the figure contains only spaces and the +, - and | symbols, then its possible to produce rotated versions of the figure using ASCII art. For example, the figure on the right is a 90 degree clockwise rotation of the one on the left (note that - and | are swapped in the rotation). Your job is to develop a program that rotates ASCII art figures like this automatically. +-+ | -+ | +- ++ +-+ | | | | | +-+ +---+ | | +-+ Input Input consists of up to 100 figures. Each figure starts with an integer 1 leq n leq 100. Following this are n lines of up to 100 characters each, containing only spaces, +, -, and |. Each line ends in a non-space character. Each image has at least one non-space character somewhere in its leftmost column. Input ends with a line containing only the number 0. Output For each figure, print a copy of the figure rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Like the input, your output should contain no spaces after the last non-space character of a line, and adjacent figures should be separated by a single blank line.
