You and your friends at the Betting against All Probability Club are visiting a casino where the following game is played. Each of the n players starts with k lives and puts in a fixed amount of money. In each round of the game, each player flips a biased coin and loses a life if she gets tails. The game ends when only one player remains, in which case this person wins, or ends in a draw if all remaining players lose their last life in the same round. If there is a winner, she wins n times her original bet. In case of a draw, no one wins anything. Being a BAPC member you quickly realize the casino has an edge here: whenever the game ends in a draw all of the contestants lose the money they bet. You are now wondering what exactly is the probability that this game ends in a draw, so you can figure out how much the casino profits on average. Input One line containing two integers, 2leq nleq 50, the number of players, 1leq kleq 50, the number of lives each player has, and a real number 0.1 leq p leq 0.9, with at most two digits after the decimal point, which is the probability the coin lands heads. Output Output a single real number: the probability of the game ending in a draw. Your answer should have an absolute error of at most 10^{-6}.
