Gunnar and his friends like games which involve rolling dice. Gunnar has a huge collection of 6-sided, 12-sided and 20-sided dice. All the games with dice started to bore him, so he came up with a new game. He rolls an s-sided die n times and wins if at least k different numbers appear in the n throws. An s-sided die contains s distinct numbers 1, dots , s on its sides. Since this is a game only for one person, Gunnar and his friends decided to make it more fun by letting other people bet on a particular game. Before you bet on a particular game, you would like to know how probable it is to throw at least k different numbers in n throws with an s-sided die. We assume that all numbers have the same probability of being thrown in each throw. Input The input consists of a single line with three integers n, s, and k (1le nle 10, 000, 1 le k le s le 500). n is the number of throws, k the number of different numbers that are needed to win and s is the number of sides the die has. Output Output one line with the probability that a player throws at least k different numbers within n throws with an s-sided die. Your answer should be within absolute or relative error at most 10^{-7}. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 3 2 0.888888889 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 3 3 0.222222222
