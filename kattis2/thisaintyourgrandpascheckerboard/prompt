You are given an n-by-n grid where each square is colored either black or white. A grid is correct if all of the following conditions are satisfied: Every row has the same number of black squares as it has white squares. Every column has the same number of black squares as it has white squares. No row or column has 3 or more consecutive squares of the same color. Given a grid, determine whether it is correct. Input The first line contains an integer n (2le nle 24; n is even). Each of the next n lines contains a string of length n consisting solely of the characters ‘B’ and ‘W’, representing the colors of the grid squares. Output If the grid is correct, print the number 1 on a single line. Otherwise, print the number 0 on a single line.
