Dezider is making a game board for the game of Convexity. He drilled a bunch of holes in a piece of wood. As the name of the game suggests the holes were on the boundary of a convex polygon. After turning over the piece of wood, Dezider froze—he had damaged the famous Picasso lithograph—The Bull No. 8. Now the question is: how to fix the damage? Drawing a bunch of straight lines to cover the holes seems like a good repair method but, of course, Dezider would like to draw as few lines as possible. He needs your help. Write a program that, given the positions of the holes, finds the smallest number of straight lines that can cover the holes. Input The only input line starts with n, the number of holes. Then 2n numbers, the coordinates of the holes, follow. You can assume that 3 leq n leq 1, 000 and the coordinates are integers between -1, 000, 000 and 1, 000, 000. The holes lie on the boundary of a convex polygon. Output The output contains one line with the smallest number ell , such that ell  straight lines can cover the holes.
