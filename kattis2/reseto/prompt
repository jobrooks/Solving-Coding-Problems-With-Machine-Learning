The sieve of Eratosthenes is a famous algorithm to find all prime numbers up to N. The algorithm is: Write down all integers between 2 and N, inclusive. Find the smallest number not already crossed out and call it P; P is prime. Cross out P and all its multiples that arenâ€™t already crossed out. If not all numbers have been crossed out, go to step 2. Write a program that, given N and K, find the K-th integer to be crossed out. Input The integers N and K (1 leq K < N leq 100, 000). Output Output the K-th number to be crossed out. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 7 3 6 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 15 12 7 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 10 7 9
