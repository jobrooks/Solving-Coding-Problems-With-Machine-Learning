Input The input consists of a single line of the form “v u in tilde{u}”, where 1 le v le 100 is an integer amount and u, tilde{u} are any of the units listed above, indicating that we are converting v u’s into tilde{u}’s. Units are given either by their full name or by their acronym, but will always be given in singular using only lower case letters. Output Output the distance converted into tilde{u}. You do not need to worry about the precise formatting of the answer (e.g., number of decimals), but either the absolute error or the relative error of your output must be smaller than 10^{-9}. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 42 ft in inch 504 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 10 furlong in lea 0.4166666666667
