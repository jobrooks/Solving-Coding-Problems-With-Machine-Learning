You just returned to your Uno game after a much-needed visit to the restroom. When you left, the player to your left had the turn, with play going clockwise. You can see that in your absence, no cards were drawn, only Reverse cards were played, and the turn just passed. Is it possible that itâ€™s your turn now? Each Reverse card flips the order of play. A player may play multiple Reverse cards at the same time before the turn passes on to the next player. Input The single line of input contains the number K of players (including yourself) and the number N of Reverse cards played in your absence. Your group uses standard Uno rules, so 2 le K le 10, but you play with two full decks of Uno cards, so 0leq Nleq 16. Output Output YES if it must be your turn, NO if it cannot be your turn, and MAYBE otherwise. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 7 1 YES Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 7 2 NO Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 7 3 MAYBE
