Fritjof is going to his first ever pub crawl. Since he doesn’t want to go all out on his very first time, he’s decided that he’s only going to visit a single pub. As he likes all pubs equally much he will stay at the pub for an equal amount of time regardless of which pub it is. To still be able to brag about the amount of time he’s been on the pub crawl, he wants to visit the pub with the longest queue time. Which pub should Fritjof go to? Input The first line of input contains an integer N (1 leq N leq 10^5), the number of pubs Fritjof can choose between. The ith of the following N lines contains the name of the ith pub p_ i, the number of people in the queue k_ i (0 leq k_ i leq 10^4) and the integer time t_ i it takes for each person to get in (1 leq t_ i leq 10^4). Each p_ i is between 1 and 10 characters long and only consists of lowercase and uppercase alphabetical characters (a-z and A-Z). All pub names are unique. Output Print one line with the name of the pub with the longest queue time and the total time it would take for Fritjof to enter the pub. If there are multiple pubs with the same queue time, print the first suitable pub in the list. Explanation of Sample 1 The last two people in the queues for Gasquen and JAPripps will both enter at time 100. But it would then take an additional 5 and 20 minutes until Fritjof could enter the pubs if he stood in their respective queues. To maximize the time spent queuing, Fritjof should queue for JAPripps for a total of 120 minutes.
