There are K different languages in the world. Each person speaks one and only one language. There are exactly N single men and N single women. Cupid, the god of love, wants to match every single man to a single woman, and vice versa. Everybody wants to find a partner who speaks the same language as s/he does. Communication between the couple is very important! Cupid asks these N men to stand in a line, and likewise for the N women. Cupid knows that the ith man speaks language a_ i and the ith woman speaks language b_ i. It is too hard for Cupid to match all people at the same time. What Cupid does is to repeatedly look at some specific interval in these two lines, pick the men and women in that interval and find the maximum number of man-woman pairs who speak the same language and can be matched. Input The first line contains three integers N, M and K (1 leq N leq 50, 000, 1 leq M leq 50, 000, 1 leq K leq 1, 000, 000). The second line contains N integers a_0, a_1, a_2, dots , a_{N-1}, where a_ i (0 leq a_ i < K) is the language spoken by the ith man. The third line contains N integers b_0, b_1, b_2, dots , b_{N-1}, where b_ i (0 leq b_ i < K) is the language spoken by the ith woman. In the next M lines, each line contains two integers L and R (0 leq L leq R < N), representing the starting and ending index of the interval. That is, Cupid is looking at men L, L+1, dots , R and women L, L+1, dots , R. Output For each interval, print the maximum number of couples Cupid could match.
