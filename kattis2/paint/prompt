You are painting a picket fence with n slats, numbered from 1 to n. There are k painters willing to paint a specific portion of the fence. However, they donâ€™t like each other, and each painter will only paint their given portion of the fence if no other painter overlaps their portion. You want to select a subset of painters that do not conflict with each other, in order to minimize the number of unpainted slats. For example, suppose there are 8 slats, and 3 painters. One painter wants to paint slats 1 rightarrow 3, one wants to paint 2 rightarrow 6, and one wants to paint 5 rightarrow 8. By choosing the first and last painters, you can paint most of the slats, leaving only a single slat (slat 4) unpainted, with no overlap between painters. Input Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input contains two integers n (1 le n le 10^{18}) and k (1 le k le 200, 000), where n is the number of slats and k is the number of painters. Each of the next k lines contains two integers a and b (1 le a le b le n), indicating that this painter wants to paint all of the slats between a and b, inclusive. Output Output a single integer, which is the smallest number of slats that go unpainted with an optimal selection of painters. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 8 3 1 3 2 6 5 8 1
