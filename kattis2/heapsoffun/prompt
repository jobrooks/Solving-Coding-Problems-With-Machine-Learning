Consider a rooted tree with n nodes, numbered 1..n. Each node will have a fixed integer b, and for each, a uniform random real number is chosen in the interval [0..b]. What is the probability that the random numbers chosen cause the tree to form a Heap (i.e., the random value in each node is less than the random values in its children)? This probability can always be expressed as a rational number frac{P}{Q}, with Q{notequiv }0 mod{10^9{+}7}. You are to output the probability as P{cdot }Q^{-1} bmod {10^9{+}7}, where Q^{-1} is an integer, which is the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 10^9{+}7 (Q! cdot ! Q^{-1}! equiv ! 1 mod{10^9{+}7}). (Note: P{cdot }Q^{-1}bmod {10^9{+}7} does not depend on whether P and Q are relatively prime, only on their ratio frac{P}{Q}.) Input Each test case will begin with a line with a single integer n (1! le ! n! le ! 300), which is the number of nodes in the tree. Each of the next n lines will contain a pair of space-separated integers b (1! le ! b! le ! 10^9) and p (0! le ! p! le ! n) describing a node of the tree, where b is the fixed integer value in the node and p is the node number of its parent. The nodes are listed in order; node 1 is first, then node 2, and so on. A single node will have a parent p{=}0. This is the root of the tree. Output Output a single integer, which is the probability expressed as (P{cdot }Q^{-1}) bmod ({10^9{+}7}).
