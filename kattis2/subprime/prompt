Image by Marina Shemesh There is an open math problem: Is every non-negative integer a substring of at least one prime number when expressed in base ten? A positive integer is a prime number if it is greater than one and not a product of two smaller positive integers. Integer a is a substring of integer b if it is equal to an integer derived from b by deleting zero or more consecutive digits of the most and least significant digits of b. For example, 123 is a substring of: underline{123}, 56underline{123}, underline{123}789, 501823underline{123}65, 4underline{123}7912underline{123}. Given two integers l and h along with an integer p, you are to check how many primes between the lth smallest prime and the hth smallest prime (both ends are inclusive) contain a substring that equals p. We are interested in substrings that may include significant leading zeroes, and thus p may have leading zeroes. A prime shall be counted only once even if the integer p occurs more than once as its substring. For example, consider l = 1, h = 10 and p = 9. This is a search from the 1st smallest prime (2) to the 10th smallest prime (29) for any prime containing the substring “9”. There are 2 such primes: 1underline{9} and 2underline{9}. Input The first line of input has two integers l and h (1 leq l leq h leq 10^5). The second line has a sequence of 1 to 6 digits giving the integer p, which may be zero or have significant leading zeroes. Output Output the count of prime numbers in the given range that contain p as a substring. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 10 9 2 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 500 1000 43 26 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 1 1000 00 10
