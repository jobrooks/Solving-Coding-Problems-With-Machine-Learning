Yraglac loves number sequences. One of his favourites is the classic Fibonacci numbers. He likes to set the base case as F_0 = F_1 = 1 and F_ n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}. Now, one can only list out the same numbers so many times before getting bored, so Yraglac came up with a new game: if he took the sequence of Fibonacci numbers modulo some k, what is the index of the first number in the new sequence that gets repeated? Yraglac only considers numbers in the sequence starting from n=2 since F_0 = F_1 is boring. Can you write a program to help Yraglac find the answer? Input The first line contains a single integer 1 leq Q leq 500, the number of queries to follow. The next Q lines each contain a single integer 2 leq k leq 1, 000, the modulo to be used for the query. It is guaranteed that some number in the sequence will be repeated. Output For each query, output the n such that F_ n is the first number in the sequence of Fibonacci numbers modulo k that has a repeat at some point in the sequence. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 4 13 22 4 5 8
