Hardwoods are the botanical group of trees that have broad leaves, produce a fruit or nut, and generally go dormant in the winter. America’s temperate climates produce forests with hundreds of hardwood species – trees that share certain biological characteristics. Although oak, maple and cherry all are types of hardwood trees, for example, they are different species. Together, all the hardwood species represent 40 percent of the trees in the United States. On the other hand, softwoods, or conifers, from the Latin word meaning “cone-bearing,” have needles. Widely available US softwoods include cedar, fir, hemlock, pine, redwood, spruce and cypress. In a home, the softwoods are used primarily as structural lumber such as 2 times 4s and 2 times 6s, with some limited decorative applications. Using satellite imaging technology, the Department of Natural Resources has compiled an inventory of every tree standing on a particular day. You are to compute the total fraction of the tree population represented by each species. Input Input to your program consists of a list of the species of every tree observed by the satellite; one tree per line. Names use only printable ASCII characters (32-126) and neither begin nor end with space. No name exceeds 20 characters. There are no more than 10, 000 species and no more than 1, 000, 000 trees. Output Print the name of each species represented in the population, in alphabetical order (by the ASCII ordering), followed by the percentage of the population it represents, accurate to an absolute error of at most 10^{-4}.
