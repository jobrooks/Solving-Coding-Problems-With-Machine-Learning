Alice and Bob decide to share a chocolate bar, which is an n by m rectangular grid of chocolate cells. They decide that Alice should get a < n cdot m pieces and that Bob should get b = n cdot m - a pieces. To split the chocolate bar, they repeatedly take a single piece of chocolate and break it either horizontally or vertically, creating two smaller pieces of chocolate. See Figure 1 for an example. What is the minimum number of splits that Alice and Bob need to perform in order to split the n-by-m chocolate bar into two piles consisting of a and b chocolate cells? Figure 1: Illustration of a solution to Sample Input 2, showing the original 10-by-10 chocolate bar split three times into pieces of size 10-by-2, 10-by-5, 3-by-3 and 7-by-3. Giving Alice the 10-by-5 and 7-by-3 pieces, she gets a total of 50 + 21 = 71 chocolate cells. Input The input consists of a single line, containing the three integers n, m and a (1 le n, m le 10^6, 1 le a < n cdot m). Output Output the minimum number of splits needed to achieve the desired division of chocolate. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 10 9 1 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 10 10 71 3
