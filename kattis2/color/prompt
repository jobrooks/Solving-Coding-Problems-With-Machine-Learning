However, he is also too lazy to do his laundry in several rounds. He would much rather buy more laundry machines! Each of Luktas’ socks have a color D_ i which has a number between 0 and 10^9 assigned to it. After some experimentation, he found that he could wash any socks with a maximum absolute color difference of K in the same machine without any discoloring. The color difference of two socks i and j is |D_ i - D_ j|. Luktas now needs to know how many washing machines he needs to wash his S socks, given that each machine can take at most C socks a time. Input The first line consists of three integers 1 le S, C le 10^5 and 0 le K le 10^9, the number of socks, the capacity of a laundry machine and the maximum color difference, respectively. Then follow one line with S integers; these are the color values D_ i of every sock. Output Output a single integer; the number of machines Luktas needs to wash all his socks.
