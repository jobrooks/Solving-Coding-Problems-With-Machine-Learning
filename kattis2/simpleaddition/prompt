Yup, yet another trivial problem. You just have to add two integers! Oh, not easy enough? Sure, let’s say that they’re positive as well. Now it should be trivial, right? Input The input consists of two lines, each containing a positive integer less than 10^{10, 000}. Oh right…I forgot to mention that the integers can be quite large. Output One line containing the sum of the two integers. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1337 42 1379 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 1 9999999999999 10000000000000
