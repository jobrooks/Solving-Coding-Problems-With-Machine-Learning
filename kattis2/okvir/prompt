Mirko has assembled an excellent crossword puzzle and now he wants to frame it. Mirko’s crossword puzzle consists of M times N letters, and the frame around it should be U characters wide on top, L characters on the left, R characters on the right and D characters on the bottom side. The frame consists of characters # (hash) and . (dot) which alternate like fields on a chessboard. These characters should be arranged in a way that, if the frame is expanded to cover the entire crossword puzzle and we treat these characters as a chessboard, the # characters should be placed as the red fields on a chessboard (i.e. the top left field). See the examples below for a better understanding of the task. Input The first line of input contains two integers M and N (1 leq M, N leq 10). The second line of input contains integers U, L, R, D (0 leq U, L, R, D leq 5). The following M lines of input contains N characters — lowercase letters of the English alphabet. These lines represent Mirko’s crossword puzzle. Output Output the framed crossword puzzle as stated in the text.
