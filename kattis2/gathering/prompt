Fictitia consists of horizontal and vertical streets only. The distance between each pair of neighboring parallel streets is always the same; we take this as the unit distance. Surely some variation could not hurt? In order to draw more support and make their unhappiness known to the municipality, a group of citizens has agreed to gather at an intersection of the city to protest. The question is: which intersection? Since there is not much difference between them, the idea was raised to select an intersection (x^*,y^*) that minimizes the total distance everyone has to travel. Since everyone lives close to an intersection, the individual distance travelled by someone who lives at (x,y) is given by |x-x^*|+|y-y^*|. However, this could present a problem for the people who live far away, since they might have trouble getting there in time. Therefore it was decided that the intersection should be at most a certain distance d away from everyone. Given that restriction, can you help them identify an intersection that minimizes the total distance everyone has to travel? Input The input consists of: one line with one integer n (2 leq n leq 100, 000), the number of citizens; n lines each with two integers x and y (0 leq x,y leq 10^9), the coordinates of each citizen’s house; one line with one integer d (0 leq d leq 2 cdot 10^9), the maximum distance that each citizen should have to travel. It is possible for multiple citizens to live at the same intersection. Output Output one line with a single integer: the smallest possible total distance that all citizens need to travel. If there is no intersection that everyone lives within a distance d of, output “impossible” instead.
