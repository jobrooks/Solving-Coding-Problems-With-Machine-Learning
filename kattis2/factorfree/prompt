A factor-free tree is a rooted binary tree where every node in the tree contains a positive integer value that is coprime with all of the values of its ancestors. Two positive integers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals 1. The inorder sequence of a rooted binary tree can be generated recursively by traversing first the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree. See Figure 1 below for the inorder sequence of one factor-free tree. Figure 1: Illustration of Sample 1. The tree is factor-free; for example, the value of the node marked “5” is coprime with all of the values of its ancestors, marked “9”, “8”, and “7”. Given a sequence a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ n, decide if it is the inorder sequence of some factor-free tree and if so construct such a tree. Input The input consists of: One line with one integer n (1 leq n leq 10^6), the length of the sequence. One line with n integers a_1, ldots , a_ n (1 leq a_ i leq 10^7 for each i), the elements of the sequence. Output If there exists a factor-free tree whose inorder sequence is the given sequence, output n values. For each value in the sequence, give the 1-based index of its parent, or 0 if it is the root. If there are multiple valid answers, print any one of them. If no such tree exists, output “impossible” instead.
