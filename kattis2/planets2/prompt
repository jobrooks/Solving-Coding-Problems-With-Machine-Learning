The spaceport likes collecting data on its visitors. We know that there are p nearby planets that generate all traffic in and out of the spaceport. Each planet contains n species and every ship contains m passengers of a particular species. No two planets contain the same species. Can you help identify how many visitors from each planet come across the spaceport? Input Input begins with a number 2le ple 15, the number of planets whose ships are known to frequent the spaceport. Then p lines follow: each line contains a unique planet name P (from one to six uppercase ASCII letters), the number of alien species on the planet 1le nle 12, and n words indicating the names of those species. Each species name s_ i is a string of one to six uppercase ASCII letters. The next line contains an integer 1le vle 15, indicating the number of visiting spacecraft. The next v lines contain an integer 1le mle 12, where m is the number of visitors, and a word r which is the name of their species, which live on one of the p planets. Output Print, in alphabetical order, each planetâ€™s name followed by the number of incoming visitors from that planet.
