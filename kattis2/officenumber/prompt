Nameplate image by PSDgraphics; Used with permission Nathan is a mathematician at a famous university who often sees patterns in the world around him. One day he notices that his office number, which happens to be 224, has an interesting property: it can be written as a sum of non-negative powers of its digits. In particular, he observes that\[ 224 = 2^5 + 2^7 + 4^3 \] Nathan wonders what other numbers have this property, and, for any such number, in how many different ways it can be expressed like this. More precisely, if n is a positive integer with base-10 digits d_1 d_2 ldots d_ k, where d_1 is the most significant digit, he would like to know how many tuples of non-negative integers (e_1, e_2, ldots , e_ k) there are such that\[ n = d_1^{e_1} + d_2^{e_2} + \ldots + d_ k^{e_ k} \] For n=224, the answer is 2, since the tuples (5,7,3) and (7,5,3) both work, but no others do. Nathan has turned to you for help with this challenge. Since 0^ e = 0 for any positive exponent, and 1^ e = 1 for any non-negative exponent, you only need to consider numbers with digits in { 2, 3, ldots , 9} . Remember that p^0 = 1 for any positive integer, p. Input The input consists of a single positive integer, n, with 1 < n < 10, 000, 000. Each digit of n is between 2 and 9, inclusive. Output Output a single integer: the number of ways n can be written as a sum of non-negative integer powers of its digits.
