The problem though, is to define the measure in which the word “best” gets a meaning. Let us consider n people, each with a firm belief on m different yes/no issues. We may think of the people’s beliefs as binary strings b_ i of length m for 0<ileq n, i.e. one string per person, with entries reflecting a person’s belief in each of the m issues. An agreement is also a binary string a of length m, indicating the agreed outcome of each of the m issues. Some would argue that the agreement a that minimises the maximum of H(b_ i-a) over all i, where H(x) is the Hamming function counting the number of non-zero entries of the vector x, is the best compromise. Unfortunately, it is widely believed that finding this agreement is computationally infeasible for n and m large. Another reasonable suggestion is the agreement a that minimises left(sum _{i=1}^ n H(b_ i-a)^ pright)^{1/p} for some positive integer p. Note in particular that when prightarrow infty , this measure coincides with the former. I for one am most content with the choice of p=1 though, don’t you agree? Input On the first line of input is a single positive integer t, telling the number of test scenarios to follow. Each test scenario is described by two positive integers nleq 100 and mleq 100, on a line of their own. Then follow n lines, each containing a binary string b_ i on m ‘0’ and ‘1’ characters. Output For each test scenario, output the assignment a that minimises the measure above with p = 1, on a row of its own. If there are several solutions, output anyone.
