Mathematics is facing a crisis. There are too many solutions, and not enough problems! Youâ€™ve come up with a new problem, but if it has too many solutions, it will simply contribute to the solution pollution! To solve your dilemma, you must find all of the solutions x to this system of congruences:Equations:  x-1& equiv 0pmod{m-1},  x(x-1)& equiv 0pmod{m(m-1)}  For example, when m=6, the four solutions for x are 1, 6, 16 and 21, e.g., 16 is a solution because 5 divides 15 and 30 divides 240. Input The first line of input contains an integer T, where 1le Tle 10^3, denoting the number of test cases. The next T lines each contain a single integer m, where 3le mle 10^{9}. Output Each test case corresponds with a single line of output. For each test case m, display, in ascending order, all integers x which are solutions to the given system of congruences and satisfy 1<x<m(m-1). You are not interested in the trivial solution x=1 because it is a solution regardless of the choice of m.
