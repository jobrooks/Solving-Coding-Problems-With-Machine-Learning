Consider an undirected graph on n vertices. A k-colouring of the graph is simply an assignment to each vertex one of the k colours. There are no other restrictions – two vertices can get the same colour even if they are connected by an edge. You are given two k-colourings s and t. You want to transform from the initial colouring s to the final colouring t step by step. In each step, each vertex may change its colour to one of its neighbours’ colour, or keep its current colour. Formally, you are looking for a sequence of k-colourings C_0, C_1, C_2, dots , C_ell  such that C_0 = s, C_ell = t, and every C_ i(x) equals either C_{i-1}(x); or C_{i-1}(y) where (x, y) is an edge in the graph The input graph is guaranteed to be connected and has no self loops. Determine whether it is possible to construct such a sequence, and output one if there is any. The sequence need not be the shortest as long as it uses at most 20, 000 steps. For example, suppose you need to start with the initial colouring on the left and end up with the final colouring on the right: One solution is as follows: Input The first line of input contains three integers n, m, and k. Here n is the number of vertices, m is the number of edges and k is the number of colours (1 leq n, k leq 100, 0 leq m leq {n choose 2}). The second line of input contains n integers, each in the range [0, k-1]. They indicate the initial colouring. The third line of input contains n integers, each in the range [0, k-1]. They indicate the final colouring. Each of the following m lines contains two integers x_ i and y_ i, representing an edge in the graph (1 leq x_ i, y_ i leq n). The input graph is connected. There are no self loops or multiple edges. Output Output Impossible if there is no such sequence. Otherwise, output one or more lines describing a sequence of colouring C_0, C_1, C_2, dots , C_ell  (ell leq 20, 000). Each line contains n integers separated by a single space, describing the colouring. The first line indicates the initial colouring and the last line indicates the final colouring. You can use at most 20, 000 steps, therefore the output contains at most 20, 001 lines.
