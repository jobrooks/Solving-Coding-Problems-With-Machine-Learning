A template for an artwork is a white grid of n times m squares. The artwork will be created by painting q horizontal and vertical black strokes. A stroke starts from square (x_1,y_1), ends at square (x_2,y_2) (x_1=x_2 or y_1=y_2) and changes the color of all squares (x,y) to black where x_1 le x le x_2 and y_1 le y le y_2. The beauty of an artwork is the number of regions in the grid. Each region consists of one or more white squares that are connected to each other using a path of white squares in the grid, walking horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. The initial beauty of the artwork is 1. Your task is to calculate the beauty after each new stroke. Figure 1 illustrates how the beauty of the artwork varies in Sample Input 1. Figure 1: Illustration of Sample Input 1. Input The first line of input contains three integers n, m and q (1 le n,m le 1000, 1 le q le 10^4). Then follow q lines that describe the strokes. Each line consists of four integers x_1, y_1, x_2 and y_2 (1 le x_1 le x_2 le n, 1 le y_1 le y_2 le m). Either x_1 = x_2 or y_1 = y_2 (or both). Output For each of the q strokes, output a line containing the beauty of the artwork after the stroke. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 6 5 2 2 2 6 1 3 4 3 2 5 3 5 4 6 4 6 1 6 4 6 1 3 3 4 3
