Many airports have moving conveyor belts in the corridors between halls and terminals. Instead of walking on the floor, passengers can choose to stand on a conveyor or, even better, walk on a conveyor to get to the end of the corridor much faster. The brand new Delft City Airport uses a similar system. However, in line with the latest fashion in airport architecture, there are no corridors: the entire airport is one big hall with a bunch of conveyor lines laid out on the floor arbitrarily. To get from a certain point A to a certain point B, a passenger can use any combination of walking on the floor and walking on conveyors. Passengers can hop on or off a conveyor at any point along the conveyor. It is also possible to cross a conveyor without actually standing on it. Walking on the floor goes at a speed of 1 meter/second. Walking forward on a conveyor goes at a total speed of 2 meter/second. Walking in reverse direction on a conveyor is useless and illegal, but you may walk on the floor immediately next to the conveyor. (Conveyors are infinitely thin.) How fast can you get from A to B? Input The first line contains four floating point numbers, X_ A, Y_ A, X_ B, and Y_ B. They describe the coordinates of your initial location A = (X_ A,Y_ A) and your final location B = (X_ B,Y_ B). The second line contains an integer N, the number of conveyors in the hall (0 leq N leq 100). The following N lines each contain four floating point numbers, X_1, Y_1, X_2, and Y_2, describing a conveyor which starts at the point (X_1,Y_1) and ends at the point (X_2,Y_2), running in a straight line from start to end. All coordinates are floating point numbers in the range (0 leq X, Y leq 1000.0), expressed in units of meters, given with at most 6 decimals after the decimal point. Conveyors are at least 1 meter long. Conveyors do not intersect or touch. Your start and destination are not on any conveyor. Output Write one line with a floating point number, the minimum time (in seconds) needed to get from A to B in seconds. Your answer may have an absolute error of at most 10^{-4}.
