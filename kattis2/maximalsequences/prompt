The problem is simple. You are given a long sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ n. Then you are given a query consisting of a start index i and a subset of integers B. What is the longest consecutive subsequence of the given sequence that starts at position i and contains only integers in B? Simple, right? Input The first line of input contains a single integer 1 leq n leq 10^5. The second line contains n integers a_1, ldots , a_ n. Each integer a_ j lies between 0 and 2^{31}-1. The third line contains a single integer q geq 1 indicating the number of queries to process. Then q lines follow, each starting with two integers 1 leq i leq n and 1 leq m leq 10^5, followed by m distinct integers b_1, ldots , b_ m. Each integer b_ j lies between 0 and 2^{31}-1. Finally, you are guaranteed the sum of all values m over all queries is at most 10^5. Output For each query, output a single line with the length of the longest prefix of a_ i, a_{i+1}, ldots , a_ n that only contains integers from B.
