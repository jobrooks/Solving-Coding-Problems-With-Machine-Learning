Picture in Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons You and your friends are in New York and are planning to go see a broadway musical. Unfortunately, New York being New York, the tickets are just a tiny bit expensive. But one of the shows has a ticket lottery each night where impecunious people such as yourself have a chance to win the right to buy slightly less expensive tickets to good seats. The lottery operates as follows. First, everyone interested enters the lottery. Then, n lucky winners are drawn, and each of these is offered to buy up to t tickets. Given the number of people p in your group (all of which entered the lottery) and the total number of people m that entered the lottery, what is the probability that you will be able to get tickets for your entire group? Assume that the n lucky winners are chosen uniformly at random from the m people that entered the lottery, and that each person can win at most once. Input The input consists of a single line containing four integers: 1 le m le 1000: the total number of people who entered the lottery. 1 le n le m: the total number of winners drawn. 1 le t le 100: the number of tickets each winner is allowed to buy. 1 le p le m: the number of people in your group. Output Output a single line containing the probability that your entire group can get tickets to the show. This probability should be given with an absolute error of at most 10^{-9}.
