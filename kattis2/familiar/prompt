A digit is called familiar to an array of positive integers if that digit appears in every elements of the array. For example, an array [14, 1470, 161240, 111000444] has 2 familiar digits: 1 and 4. Also note that, 0 is not a familiar digit because 0 doesn’t appear in the first element 14 (we don’t count leading zeros). Given A, B, k and d, your task is to count the number of increasing arrays X=[X_1,X_2,ldots ,X_ K] of length K that has exactly d familiar digits where: A leq X_1<X_2<ldots <X_ K leq B Input The input starts with the number of test cases T (T le 100). Then T test cases follow, each is printed in a line and consists of 4 numbers A, B, K and d (1 leq A leq B < 10^{18}, 2 leq K leq 10, 0 leq d leq 10). Output For each test case, print the result modulo 10^9+7 in a single line. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 1 9 2 0 1 9 2 1 1 99 2 1 36 0 1503
