We need to guard a set of points of interest using sentry robots that can not move or turn. We can position a sentry at any position facing either north, south, east or west. Once a sentry is settled, it guards the points of interest that are infront of it. If two or more points are in the same row or column a single robot can guard them all. Unfortunately, there are also some obstacles that the robot cannot see through. From a set of points of interest and obstacles lying on a grid, calculate the minimum number of robots needed to guard all the points. In order to guard a point of interest, a robot must be facing the direction of this point and must not be any obstacles in between. Given the following grid, where # represents an obstacle and * a point of interest, the minimum number of robots needed is 2 (a possible position and orientation is shown using arrows for each robot). Note that this is not the actual input or output, just a figure. Grid Solution . . . . . . . . . . . . . * # * . . . * # * . . . . # . . . . . # . . . . * # * . . . ^ # ^ . .

Input The first line of the input has an integer C (1 leq C leq 50) representing the number of test cases that follow. Before each test case there is an empty line. For each case, the first line has 2 integers, Y and X (1 leq Y, X leq 100), representing the height and width of the grid. The next line has an integer that indicates the number of points of interest P. The following P lines will have the positions p_ y and p_ x of the points of interest, one point per line (1 leq p_ y leq Y, 1 leq p_ x leq X). The next line has an integer that indicates the number of obstacles W. The following W lines will have the positions w_ y and w_ x of an obstacle, one per line (1 leq w_ y leq Y, 1 leq w_ x leq X). It holds that 0 leq P + W leq Y cdot X, and that all positions are different. Output For each test case print the minimum number of robots needed to guard all the points of interest, one per line.
