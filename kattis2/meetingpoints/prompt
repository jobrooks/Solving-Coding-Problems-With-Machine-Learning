Here are the details: Each line is specified by two distinct points, (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), through which the line passes. All n lines are distinct, i.e., no two lines will be coincident (lie on top of each other). You are guaranteed that there is no point in the plane at which three or more lines intersect. Input The first input line contains an integer n (2 leq n leq 100, 000), the number of lines in the x-y plane. This is followed by n input lines, each containing the specification of a line in the plane given as four space-separated integers, x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2. Each coordinate is at most 10^6 in absolute value. Output Output a single integer, the number of intersection points.
