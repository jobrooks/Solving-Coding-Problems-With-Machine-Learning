Besides the prestigious ACM-ICPC contest, Nha Trang University also hosted the Vietnamese Collegiate Olympiads in Informatics 2016. This Olympiad had several events where students compete individually to show their skills and knowledge. After a successful contest this year, N junior students in Nha Trang University expressed their interests to join the team next year to represent their university. But in order for them to be at a medal contender level, the coach, Mr. Van, has to teach them M topics. The {i}^textrm {th} student will require {a}_{i,j} minutes to understand the {j}^textrm {th} topic. Teaching K students {X}_{1}, {X}_{2},ldots , {X}_{k} the {j}^textrm {th} topic will require max({a}_{{x}_{k,j}}, {a}_{{x}_{2,j}},ldots , {a}_{{x}_{k,j}}) minutes and teaching them all M topics will require sum _{j=1}^{M} max({a}_{{x}_{1,j}}, {a}_{{x}_{2,j}},ldots , {a}_{{x}_{k,j}}) minutes. Given K - the number of students in a group to train, your task is to help Mr. Van decide who he should pick in order to minimize the total time he needs to teach them all M topics. Input The input consists of several datasets. The first line of the input contains the number of datasets which is a positive integer and is not greater than 100. The following lines describe the datasets. Each dataset is described by the following lines: The first line contains three integers N, M, Q (1 leq Q leq N leq 20, M leq 10, 000). The {i}^textrm {th} line of the next N lines contains M integers {a}_{i,j} (0 leq {a}_{i,j} leq {10}^{9}). The {u}^textrm {th} line of the next Q lines contains a query which is an integer K (1 leq K leq N) representing the number of students in the group that Mr. Van needs to train. Output For each dataset, output Q lines where the {i}^textrm {th} line contains the minimal time required for the {i}^textrm {th} query.
