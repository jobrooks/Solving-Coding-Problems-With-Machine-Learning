Today you are doing your calculus homework, and you are tasked with finding a Lipschitz constant for a function f(x), which is defined for N integer numbers x and produces real values. Formally, the Lipschitz constant for a function f is the smallest real number L such that for any x and y with f(x) and f(y) defined we have:\[ |f(x) - f(y)| <= L \cdot |x - y|. \] Input The first line contains N – the number of points for which f is defined. The next N lines each contain an integer x and a real number z, which mean that f(x) = z. Input satisfies the following constraints: 2 leq N leq 200, 000. All x and z are in the range -10^9 leq x,z leq 10^9. All x in the input are distinct. Output Print one number – the Lipschitz constant. The result will be considered correct if it is within an absolute error of 10^{-4} from the jury’s answer.
