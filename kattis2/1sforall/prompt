The complexity of an integer is the minimum number of 1’s needed to represent it using only addition, multiplication and parentheses. For example, the complexity of 2 is 2 (writing 2 as 1+1) and the complexity of 12 is 7 (writing 12 as (1+1+1)times (1+1+1+1)). We’ll modify this definition slightly to allow the concatenation operation as well. This operation (which we’ll represent using ©) takes two integers and “glues” them together, so 12 © 34 becomes the four digit number 1234. Using this operation, the complexity of 12 is now 3 (writing it either as (1  © 1) + 1 or 1 © (1+1)). Note that the concatenation operation ignores any initial zeroes in the second operand: 1 © 01 does not result in 101 but results in 11. We’ll give you 1 guess what the object of this problem is. Input Each test case consists of a single line containing an integer n, where 0 < n leq 100, 000. Output Output the complexity of the number, using the revised definition above.
