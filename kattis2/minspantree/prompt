Input The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with a line with two non-negative integers, 1 le n le 20, 000 and 0 le m le 30, 000, separated by a single space, where n is the numbers of nodes in the graph and m is the number of edges. Nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1. Then follow m lines, each line consisting of three (space-separated) integers u, v and w indicating that there is an edge between u and v in the graph with weight -20, 000 le w le 20, 000. Edges are undirected. Input will be terminated by a line containing 0 0, this line should not be processed. Output For every test case, if there is no minimum spanning tree, then output the word Impossible on a line of its own. If there is a minimum spanning tree, then you first output a single line with the cost of a minimum spanning tree. On the following lines you output the edges of a minimum spanning tree. Each edge is represented on a separate line as a pair of numbers, x and y (the endpoints of the edge) separated by a space. The edges should be output so that x < y and should be listed in the lexicographic order on pairs of integers. If there is more than one minimum spanning tree for a given graph, then any one of them will do.
