Nikolaj has been programming for many years, but never really understood the point of writing readable code. Nikolaj’s variable names are always c_1, c_2, c_3, etc. Sometimes Nikolaj wants to declare a new variable called c_ i, but the name c_ i may already be taken. When that happens he tries the names c_{2i}, c_{3i}, etc., until he finds a name that is not already taken. Write a program that given a list of N variable names Nikolaj wants to use, determines the names he ends up choosing using the above strategy. Input The first line contains an integer N, the number of variables, where 1 leq N leq 2 cdot 10^5. Each of the following N lines contains an integer x with 1 leq x leq 10^4. This means that Nikolaj wants to declare a new variable called c_ x. Nikolaj declares the variables in input order. Output For each of the N integers x, print y such that Nikolaj created the variable c_ y. Explanation of Sample Input In Sample Input 1, the following will happen: Variable c_1 is declared. Variable c_3 is declared. Nikolaj would like to declare c_1, but that’s taken, so he declares c_2. Nikolaj would like to declare c_2, but that’s taken, so he declares c_4. Nikolaj would like to declare c_1, but that’s taken, so he declares c_5. Nikolaj would like to declare c_5, but that’s taken, so he declares c_{10}. Nikolaj would like to declare c_5, but that’s taken, so he declares c_{15}. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 7 1 3 1 2 1 5 5 1 3 2 4 5 10 15
