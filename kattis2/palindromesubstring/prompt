A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backwards or forwards. For this problem, we’re going to find all the different palindromes that occur inside a string. We’ll say that string a is a nontrivial palindrome substring of b if a is a substring of b, the sequence of characters in a reads the same forwards or backwards, and a is at least two characters long. Here, a substring of b = b_1 b_2 ldots b_ n is any string b_ i b_{i+1} ldots b_{i+j} where i geq 1 and j geq 1 and i + j leq n. Input Input consists of up to 100 lines. Each line contains a string of 1 to 1000 characters chosen from a–z. Input ends at end of file. Output For each input string, print out the list of all of its non-trivial palindrome substrings. Each list of palindromes should be sorted lexicographically, and should not contain duplicates. Print a blank line after the output for each input string.
