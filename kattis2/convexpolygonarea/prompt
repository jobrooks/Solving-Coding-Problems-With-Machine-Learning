For this problem, you just need to be able to calculate the area of convex polygons. Input Input starts with an integer 1 le n le 100, indicating the number of convex polygons. The next n lines each contain one convex polygon description. Each begins with an integer 3 le m le 100 indicating the number of points in the polygon. Following this are m pairs of integers, where each pair represents the x and y coordinates of a vertex. The bounds on the coordinates are -5, 000 le x, y le 5, 000. The vertices are given in counter-clockwise order, and no two vertices are the same. As is typical for a polygon, the last vertex is connected to the first one. Output For each polygon, output its area. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 3 1 1 2 1 2 2 4 0 0 10 0 13 5 10 8 0.5 52
