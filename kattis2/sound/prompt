In digital recording, sound is described by a sequence of numbers representing the air pressure, measured at a rapid rate with a fixed time interval between successive measurements. Each value in the sequence is called a sample. An important step in many voice-processing tasks is breaking the recorded sound into chunks of non-silence separated by silence. To avoid accidentally breaking the recording into too few or too many pieces, the silence is often defined as a sequence of m samples where the difference between the lowest and the highest value does not exceed a certain treshold c. Write a program to detect silence in a given recording of n samples according to the given parameter values m and c. Input The first line of the input contains three integers: n (1 le n le 1, 000, 000), the number of samples in the recording; m (1 le m le 10, 000), the required length of the silence; and c (0 le c le 10, 000), the maximal noise level allowed within silence. The second line of the input contains n integers a[i] (0 le a[i] le 1, 000, 000 for 1 le i le n), separated by single spaces: the samples in the recording. Output You should output a list of all values of i such that max (a[i dots i + m - 1]) - min(a[i dots i + m - 1]) le c (where a[i dots j] means the values a[i], a[i + 1], dots , a[j]). The values should be listed in increasing order, each on a separate line. If there is no silence in the input, write NONE on the first and only line of the output.
