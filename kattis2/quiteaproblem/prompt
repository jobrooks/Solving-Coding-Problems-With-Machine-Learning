It gets tiring, looking for all ways in which the word ‘problem’ can be used (and mis-used) in the news media. And yet, that’s been your job for several years: looking through news stories for that word. Wouldn’t it be better if you could automate the process? Input Each line of input is one test case. Lines are at most 80 characters long. There are at most 1000 lines of input. Input ends at end of file. Output For each line of input, print yes if the line contains ‘problem’, and no otherwise. Any capitalization of ‘problem’ counts as an occurrence.

Working out problems with a pairing partner can be a lot like working out problems with a significant other. During one recent rough patch, Jamie Kite, a developer, sat her partner down for a talk. "Hey, it feels like we're driving in different directions," she recalls saying. "It's like any relationship," Ms. Kite said. "If you don't talk about the problems, it's not going to work." When those timeouts don't solve the problem, partners can turn to on-staff coaches who can help with counseling. "People who have been pairing a while, they'll start acting like old married couples," said Marc Phillips, one of the coaches. People can be as much of a challenge as writing software.
