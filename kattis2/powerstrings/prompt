Given two strings a and b we define acdot b to be their concatenation. For example, if a = text {"abc"} and b = text {"def"} then acdot b = text {"abcdef"}. If we think of concatenation as multiplication, exponentiation by a non-negative integer is defined in the normal way: a^0 = text {""} (the empty string) and a^{n+1} = acdot {a^ n}. Input The input consists of up to 10 test cases. Each test case is a line of input containing s, a string of lower case letters (a-z). The length of s will be at least 1 and will not exceed 2, 000, 000 characters. A line containing a period follows the last test case. Output For each s you should print the largest n such that s = a^ n for some string a. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 abcd aaaa ababab . 1 4 3
