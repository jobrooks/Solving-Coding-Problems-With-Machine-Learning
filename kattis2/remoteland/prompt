In the Republic of Remoteland, the people celebrate their independence day every year. However, as it was a long long time ago, nobody can remember when it was exactly. The only thing people can remember is that today, the number of days elapsed since their independence (D) is a perfect square, and moreover it is the largest possible such number one can form as a product of distinct numbers less than or equal to n. As the years in Remoteland have 1, 000, 000, 007 days, their citizens just need D modulo 1, 000, 000, 007. Note that they are interested in the largest D, not in the largest D modulo 1, 000, 000, 007. Input The input contains at most 25 testcases. Every test case is described by a single line with an integer n, (1 le n le 10, 000, 000). The input ends with a line containing 0. Output For each test case, output the number of days ago the Republic became independent, modulo 1, 000, 000, 007, one per line.
