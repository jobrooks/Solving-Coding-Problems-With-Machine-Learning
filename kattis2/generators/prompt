The volcanic island of Fleeland has never had a proper electric net, but finally the administration of the island have agreed to build the island’s power plants and network. On the island’s coast are its n cities. The administration has surveyed the cities and proposed m of them as possible locations for a power plant, with the ith proposal stating that the company can build a plant in city c_ i for cost a_ i. These power plants are very modern and a single plant could power the whole island, but the volcano makes building power lines across the island a dangerous affair. For 1 leq i < n, the company can build power lines between cities i and i+1 for a cost of b_ i, and between cities n and 1 for a cost of b_ n. A city will receive power if it contains a power plant or is connected to a city with a power plant via power lines. What is the cheapest way to power all the cities on the island? Input One line containing two integers n (3leq n leq 10^5) and m (1leq m leq n), the number of cities and the number of possible locations for a power plant. Then follow m lines, the ith of which contains c_ i (1 leq c_ i leq n) and a_ i (1 leq a_ i leq 10^9), the ith possible location for a power plant, and the cost to build it. Then follows a line containing n integers b_ i (1 leq b_ i leq 10^9), the costs of building the power lines. The values of c_{1,ldots ,n} are unique and given in strictly increasing order. Output Output the minimal cost of powering all cities on the island. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 2 1 100 2 200 150 300 150 400 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 2 1 100 2 200 300 300 150 450
