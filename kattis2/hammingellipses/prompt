In geometry, ellipses are defined by two focal points f_1, f_2 and a length D. The ellipse consists of all points p such that mathop {mathrm{distance}}(f_1, p) + mathop {mathrm{distance}}(f_2, p) = D. When one normally thinks of ellipses, it is in the context of the Euclidean 2D plane, with the Euclidean distance as a distance measure. This problem explores a different kind of ellipse. The space we will work in is the space of words of length n using an alphabet of q different symbols, often denoted as F_ q^ n. As you can probably see, for given values of q and n, there are q^ n different words (points) in the space F_ q^ n. For a distance measure, we use the Hamming distance. The Hamming distance between two words x, y in F_ q^ n is simply the number of positions where the symbols that make up the words x and y differ. For example, the Hamming distance between words 01201 and 21210 is 3 because there are 3 positions where the words have different symbols. The Hamming distance between any two words in F_ q^ n will always be an integer between 0 and n, inclusive. Within the space F_ q^ n, we now define the Hamming ellipse as the set of all points p such that mathop {mathrm{hammingdistance}}(f_1, p) + mathop {mathrm{hammingdistance}}(f_2, p) = D. Given values q and n, focal points f_1 and f_2 and distance D, we ask you to determine the number of points p in F_ q^ n that lie on this Hamming ellipse. Input The first line contains three integers q (2 le q le 10), n (1 le n le 100) and D (1 le D le 2 n). The second and third lines specify the two focal points f_1 and f_2, each formatted as a string of length n using digits { 0, 1 ldots q - 1} . Output Output one line containing a single integer, denoting the number of points on the ellipse. The input is chosen such that the answer is less than 2^{63}.
