Given an integer n, its hailstone sequence is constructed in the following way. First, the integer n is itself added as the first number of the sequence. The following procedure is then repeated. If the last integer a added to the sequence is even, we add frac{a}{2} to the sequence. If it is odd, we add 3a + 1 to the sequence. Whenever the integer 1 is added to the sequence, the procedure concludes and the sequence generated is the hailstone sequence of n. For example, with n = 7, we get the sequence\[ 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 \] This has length 17. It is unknown if the hailstone sequence is finite for every positive integer n. Proving whether this is the case or not is known as the 3n + 1 problem, or the Collatz conjecture. It has been proven that the longest sequence among all n le 10^{12} has length 1349. Given an integer n, determine the length of its hailstone sequence. Input The input consists of an integer n (1 le n le 10^{12}). Output Output a single integer â€“ the length of the sequence. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 7 17
