You know the old saying: You can’t fit a square peg in a round hole! Well, obviously you can if the hole is big enough. I guess you can’t fit a square peg into a round hole that is sufficiently small. Given the side length L of a square peg and the radius R of a circular hole, determine if a square with side length L can be placed within a circle of radius R. Input Input consists of two space-separated integers L,R (1 leq L, R leq 1, 000) on a single line. Output If a square of side length L can fit in a circle with radius R, output a single line with the phrase fits. Otherwise, the square cannot fit within the circle then output a single line with the phrase nope. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 3 nope Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 4 3 fits
