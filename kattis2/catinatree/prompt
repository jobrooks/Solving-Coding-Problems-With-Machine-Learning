CC BY-2.0, Just a kitten in a tree by Zoe Shuttleworth via Flickr A cat lives in a tree that has N nodes. She will demarcate her territory by “marking” some of the tree nodes. Marked nodes may not be closer to each other than distance D, or the smell will be too overwhelming. Find the maximum number of nodes that the cat can mark. Input First line has two integers, N and D. The 0-th node is the root node of the tree. Then follows N-1 lines, the i-th of which contain a single integer x_ i with 0 leq x_ i < i (starting with i = 1). This means that node x_ i is connected to node i. We always have 1 leq N, D leq 2 cdot 10^5. Output Output should contain one integer: the maximum number of nodes that can be marked.
