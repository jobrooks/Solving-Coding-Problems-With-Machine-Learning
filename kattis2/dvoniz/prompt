We say that a sequence of 2K elements is interesting if neither the sum of the first K elements, nor the sum of the last K elements, is greater than S. A sequence A of length N is given. For every element, output the length of the longest interesting subsequence starting with that element. Input The first line contains integers N and S (2 leq N leq 100, 000, 1 leq S leq 2 cdot 10^9 ). The following N lines contain the sequence A, one integer per line. The integers are non-negative and their sum does not exceed 2cdot 10^9. Output Output N lines. The i-th line must contain one integer, the length of the longest interesting subsequence starting with the i-th element. If an interesting subsequence at that position doesnâ€™t exist, output 0 (zero).
