Ylva loves bonbons, probably more than anything else on this planet. She loves them so much that she made a large plate of R cdot C bonbons for her fikaraster1. Ylva has a large wooden tray which can fit R rows of C bonbons per row, that she will put the bonbons on. Her bonbons have three different fillings: Nutella Buttercream, Red Wine Chocolate Ganache, and Strawberry Whipped Cream. Since Ylva is a master chocolatier, she knows that presentation is 90%  of the execution. In particular, it looks very bad if two bonbons of the same color are adjacent to each other within a row or a column on the tray. We call an arrangement of bonbons where this is never the case a good arrangement. Given the number of bonbons of each flavour, and the size of Ylva’s tray, can you help her find a good arrangement of the bonbons, or determine that no such arrangement exists? Input The first line of input contains the two space-separated integers 2 le R, C le 1000. The next line contains three non-negative space-separated integers a, b, c – the number of bonbons of the three flavours which Ylva has baked. It is guaranteed that a + b + c = R cdot C. Both R and C will be even. Output If no good arrangement can be found, output impossible. Otherwise, output R lines, each containing C characters, representing a good arrangement. Each row should contain only characters A, B, C, depending on which flavour should be placed on a certain position. The number of A bonbons placed must be equal to A, and so on.
