SoCCat the Combinatorician is a very combinatoricky cat. Currently, SoCCat is challenging you to solve a combinatorics problem! SoCCat challenges you to solve the following combinatorics problem: Given a graph G with 4n vertices, along with two permutations p and q, each with size 2n on the set { 1, 2, ldots , 2n} . Add the following 4n edges: For each i in { 1, 2, 3, ldots , 2n} , add an edge between vertices i and i + 2n. For each i in { 1, 2, 3, ldots , n} , add an edge between vertices p_ i and p_{i + n}. For each i in { 1, 2, 3, ldots , n} , add an edge between vertices q_ i + 2n and q_{i + n} + 2n. Suppose the permutations p and q are chosen uniformly at random among the (2n)! possible permutations. Note that the permutations p and q are independent of each other. What is the expected number of connected components in the resulting graph? Suppose the expected number of connected components in the resulting graph is E. Then, let E’ = E times (2n)! times (2n)!. It can be proven that E’ is always an integer. You are required to output the value of E’ bmod 1, 000, 003, 233. In other words, you should output the sum of the number of connected components in the resulting graph, over all (2n)! times (2n)! possible permutations p and q. Input The first line of input contains an integer n, as described in the problem statement (1 leq n leq 3233). Output Output a single integer, the value of E’ bmod 1, 000, 003, 233. Notes In the sample test case, there’s a frac{1}{3} chance that there are 2 connected components, and frac{2}{3} chance that there is 1 connected component. Therefore, E=frac{1}{3} times 2 + frac{2}{3} times 1 = frac{4}{3}, and the output should be frac{4}{3} times (4!)^2 = 768. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 768
