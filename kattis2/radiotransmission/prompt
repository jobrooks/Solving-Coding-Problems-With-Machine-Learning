A radio station needs to transmit a message to several recipients. To ensure all listeners get it, the message is played again and again in a continuous loop. You’re given a sequence of characters recieved by one of the recipients. It is known that the sequence is at least as long as the message. Your task is to write a program the extracts the message transmitted by the station. More formally, your program needs to find the shortest subsring S’ of the input string S such that S in turn is a substring of the (sufficiently long) repetition S’ + S’ + ldots + S’. Input The first line contains a single integer 1 le L le 1, 000, 000, the length of the string S. The second line contains exactly L characters, the string S itself. The sequence consists of lowercase letters a-z. Output The program should write one line to standard output containing a single integer: the length L’ of the message S’. Note that L’ must be the smallest possible. If there are multiple smallest L’, you may output any of them. Explanation of Sample 1 The message could (among other options) be “abc”, “cab” or “abcabc”, but there is no possible message shorter than 3 characters. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 8 cabcabca 3
