Input Input contains several test cases. Each test case begins with an integer n (3 leq n leq 1000). Then follow the n vertices of a simple polygon, one per line, each of the form x y. The points may be given in either clockwise or counterclockwise order. Then comes an integer m (m leq 100), giving the number of points to test, followed by m lines, each containing a point in the same format as above. Coordinates are integers with absolute value bounded by 10000. The input is terminated by a case beginning with 0. Output For each test case, output m lines, one for each point to test. The i:th output for a test case should be one of “in”, “out”, “on”, depending on whether the i:th test point lies inside, outside, or on the given polygon.
