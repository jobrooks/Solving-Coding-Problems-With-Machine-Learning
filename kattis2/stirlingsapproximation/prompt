The value of n! = 1cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot ldots cdot (n-1) cdot n can be quite large, and it can be tedious to calculate. Fortunately for us, the French mathematician Abraham de Moivre (1667-1754) and the Scottish mathematician James Stirling (1692-1770) came up with a nice approximation:\[ n!\approx S(n)=\sqrt {2pi n}\frac{n^ n}{e^ n}. \] This is known as Stirling’s approximation. For this problem, determine how good Stirling’s approximation is for various n. Input Input consists of up to 500 test cases, one per line. Each test case has a single integer 0 < n leq 10^5. Input ends when n=0. Output For each test case, print out n! / S(n) with an absolute error at most 10^{-8}.
