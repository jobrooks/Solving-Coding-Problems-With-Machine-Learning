Maddison and her friends live and work on the perimeter of a unit square with bottom left corner at (0, 0) and top right corner at (1, 1). They’ve decided to build a square community garden centered at (0.5, 0.5), but they can’t decide how big it should be! The garden can’t rotate, so a garden of side length ell  has corners at (0.5 pm frac{ell }{2}, 0.5 pm frac{ell }{2}). It takes longer to walk through the garden compared to the open space that exists right now, and each of Maddison’s friends have a limit as to how long they are willing to walk to work. They each walk at 0.1 units per minute in the open space or on the perimeter of the garden, but 0.1 cdot delta  units per minute through the garden. Maddison’s friends are also very stubborn. They will always walk in a straight line from home to work, no matter how much the garden slows them down. Find the largest side length 0 leq ell leq 1 of a square garden centered at (0.5, 0.5) such that all of Maddison’s friends can still get to work on time. Input The first line of input contains integer N (1 leq N leq 10^5) and real number delta  (0 < delta leq 1). Then N lines follow, each containing five real numbers x_ h, y_ h, x_ w, y_ w, t where (x_ h, y_ h) and (x_ w, y_ w) are points denoting the home and workplace respectively of one of Maddison’s friends and 0 leq t leq 120 is the maximum number of minutes that friend is willing to take to walk between their home and workplace. The points (x_ h, y_ h) and (x_ w, y_ w) are always on the perimeter of the unit square. All real numbers are given with exactly 6 digits of precision after the decimal. It is guaranteed that all of Maddison’s friends can get to work on time when there is no garden. Output Output a single floating-point value ell  (0 leq ell leq 1) that is the maximum valid side length of Maddison’s Square Garden. Your answer will be considered correct if it is within an absolute error of 10^{-6} of the correct answer.
