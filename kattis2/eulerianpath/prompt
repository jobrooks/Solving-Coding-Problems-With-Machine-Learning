Input The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with a line with two non-negative integers, 2 le n le 10, 000 and 1 le m le 50, 000, separated by a single space, where n is the numbers of nodes in the graph and m is the number of edges. Nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1. Then follow m lines, each line consisting of two (space-separated) integers u and v indicating that there is an edge from u to v in the graph. Input will be terminated by a line containing 0 0, this line should not be processed. Output For each test case, output a line consisting of a space-separated list of the nodes visited by an Eulerian path if one exists (if there are multiple Eulerian paths, any one is acceptable, so for the second case below, 1 0 1 is also a valid solution), or the word Impossible if no Eulerian path exists.
