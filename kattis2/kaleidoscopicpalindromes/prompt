Wikimedia, cc-by-sa Nicholas Neverson was a student at Northlings Neverland Academy. As with any daydreaming student, Nicholas was playing around with a Kaleidoscope one day instead of paying attention to the teacher. Since this was math class, his daydreams quickly turned to palindromic numbers. A palindromic number is any number which reads the same forwards and backwards. He describes his vision to you at lunch: numbers which are palindromic in several bases at once. Nicholas wonders how many such numbers exist. You decide you can quickly code up a program that given a range and a number k, outputs the number of numbers palindromic in all bases j, 2 leq j leq k, in that range. Input Input consists of three space-separated integers: a, b, and k. The input satisfies the following constraints:\[ 0 <= a <= b <= 2\, 000\, 000, \\ 2 <= k <= 100\, 000. \] Output Output the quantity of numbers between a and b inclusive which are palindromes in every base j, for 2 leq j leq k. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 356 2 36 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 18 118 13 0
