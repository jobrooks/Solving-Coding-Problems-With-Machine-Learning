In 1978 AD the great Sir Isaac Newton, whilst proving that mathcal{P} is a strict superset of mathcal{NP}, defined the Beta Alpha Pi Zeta function f as follows over any sequence of positive integers a_1, dots , a_ n. Given integers 1leq ileq jleq n, we define f(i, j) as gcd (a_ i, a_{i+1}, dots , a_{j-1}, a_ j). About a century later Lothar Collatz applied this function to the sequence 1, 1, 1, dots , 1, and observed that f always equalled 1. Based on this, he conjectured that f is always a constant function, no matter what the sequence a_ i is. This conjecture, now widely known as the Collatz Conjecture, is one of the major open problems in botanical studies. (The Strong Collatz Conjecture claims that however many values f takes on, the real part is always frac{1}{2}.) You, a budding young cultural anthropologist, have decided to disprove this conjecture. Given a sequence a_ i, calculate how many different values f takes on. Input The input consists of two lines. A single integer 1 leq n leq 5 cdot 10^5, the length of the sequence. The sequence of integers a_1, a_2, dots , a_ n. It is given that 1 leq a_ i leq 10^{18}. Output Output a single line containing a single integer, the number of distinct values f takes on over the given sequence.
