Every so often, a shipment of universal robots comes from Earth to Mars in order to help you with routine colonization tasks. The robots are called Organ-free Men (precisely OFMv5001.41.912) and each one of them is identified by a unique serial number, which is a positive integer. To prevent space theft, OFMs are transported from Earth to Mars in a locked state and have to be first unlocked by a special password. The password to unlock an OFM is based on its serial number and a function f(x). The function f(x) is defined as follows. If 0 le x le 9, then f(x) = x!, and if x > 9, then f(x) = (x mod 10)! + f(lfloor x/10 rfloor ). The brackets lfloor rfloor  denote the floor value of a number (e.g. lfloor 2.43 rfloor = 2). Exclamation mark denotes the factorial, i.e., x! = 1 cdot 2 cdot cdots cdot x for x > 0 and 0! = 1. To unlock an OFM with a serial number y, you need to input smallest such non-negative integer x, so that f(x) = y holds. Will you manage to unlock all robots that were shipped to you? Input The input consists of one integer y (1 le y le 10^9), the serial number of a particular OFM. Output Output a single non-negative integer x, the password to unlock the particular OFM. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 12 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 20 2333
