Anthony has two multiple choice assignments to hand in today. The answer to each assignment is a string, where the i^textrm {th} letter represents the answer to the i^textrm {th} question. But instead of handing in two strings, Anthony only hands in a single string. He claims he answered every question correctly but his little sister Cora merged his two strings into a single string. Moreover, Cora merged his string in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied: For any two integers 0leq i<j<|s_1| (where |s_1| is the length of s_1), the index of s_1[i] in s is less than the index of s_1[j] in s For any two integers 0leq i<j<|s_2|, the index of s_2[i] in s is less than the index of s_2[j] in s Can you help Anthony’s teacher verify whether Anthony’s claim is possible? Input The first line contains a single string s. It is guaranteed that 2leq |s|leq 10, 000. The next two lines contain strings s_1 and s_2 respectively. It is guaranteed that 1leq |s_1|, |s_2|leq 5, 000 and |s_1|+|s_2|=|s|. All the strings consists of only lowercase English letters. Output If Anthony’s claim is possible, print “yes” (without quotes). Otherwise, print “no” (without quotes). Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 aabcad aba acd yes Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 aabcad acb aad no
