In the famous logic game Peg, pieces jump over other pieces to remove them from the game, until only one piece is left. Here is the initial layout of the board: ooo ooo ooooooo ooo.ooo ooooooo ooo ooo The lowercase letter ’o’ represents a piece, while the character ’.’ is an empty square. In one move, a player may choose one piece and one of the four main directions (up, down, left, right), if there is another piece in that direction, and an empty square behind it. The chosen piece jumps over the other piece and settles in the empty square behind it, while the piece being jumped over is removed from the game. Write a program that calculates the number of legal moves, given the state of the board. Input The board is represented by seven lines containing seven characters each. The first two and last two characters on the first two and last two lines are always spaces, and all remaining characters are either ’o’ (lowercase letter) or ’.’ (period character). Output Output the number of legal moves. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 ooo ooo ooooooo ooo.ooo ooooooo ooo ooo 4 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 ooo ooo ..ooo.. oo...oo ..ooo.. ooo ooo 12
