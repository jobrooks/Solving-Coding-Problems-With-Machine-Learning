An edit step is a transformation from one word x to another word y such that x and y are words in the dictionary, and x can be transformed to y by adding, deleting, or changing one letter. So the transformation from “dig” to “dog” or from “dog” to “do” are both edit steps. An edit step ladder is a lexicographically ordered sequence of words w_1, w_2, ldots w_ n such that the transformation from w_ i to w_{i+1} is an edit step for all i from 1 to n-1. For a given dictionary, you are to compute the length of the longest edit step ladder. Input The input to your program consists of the dictionary – a set of lower case words in lexicographic order – one per line. No word exceeds 16 letters and there are no more than 50, 000 words in the dictionary. Output The output consists of a single integer, the number of words in the longest edit step ladder. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 cat dig dog fig fin fine fog log wine 5
