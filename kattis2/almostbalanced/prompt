Consider making a string s of textbf{even} length n consisting of 0 and 1, where s must satisfy m conditions. The i^{th} condition is represented by integers T_ i, L_ i, R_ i (1 leq L_ i<R_ i leq n), V_ i (0 leq V_ i). Note that L_ i notequiv R_ i text {(mod 2)}, or equivalently there is an textbf{even} number of elements within each range. If T_ i = 0, This means that there are at most V_ i more 0s than 1s in the L_ i^{th} and R_ i^{th} characters (inclusive) of s. If T_ i = 1, This means that there are at most V_ i more 1s than 0s in the L_ i^{th} and R_ i^{th} characters (inclusive) of s. Find the lexicographically smallest string s that satisfies all conditions. It can be proved that the constraints of the problem guarantee the existence of s that satisfies the conditions. Input The first line contains two integers n and m (2leq nleq 300, 000; 1leq mleq 300, 000) â€” the length of the string and the number of conditions. Note once again that n is textbf{even}. The i^{th} of the following m lines contains four integers T_ i in { 0,1} , L_ i, R_ i (1 leq L_ i < R_ i leq n), V_ i (0leq V_ i leq R_ i - L_ i + 1). Note that L_ i notequiv R_ i text {(mod 2)}. Output Print the lexicographically smallest string s satisfying the conditions.
