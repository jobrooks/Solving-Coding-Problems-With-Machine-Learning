You are given an array of N integers. Find a consecutive subsequence of numbers of the length at least K that has the maximal possible average. Input The first line of input contains two integers N (1 leq N leq 3 cdot 10^5) and K (1 leq K leq N). The second line of input contains N integers a_ i (1 leq a_ i leq 10^6). Output The first and only line of output must contain the maximal possible average. An absolute deviation of pm 0.001 from the official solution is permitted. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 1 1 2 3 4 4.000000 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 4 2 2 4 3 4 3.666666 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 6 3 7 1 2 1 3 6 3.333333
