In order to become the very best Pokenom trainer, Bash needs to prepare a team of Pokenom to participate in the Pokenom world championship. Bash has N Pokenoms. Each Pokenom has 3 stats: Attack, Defense and Health. Bash wants to select K Pokenoms with highest attack, K Pokenoms with highest defense and K Pokenoms with highest Health. After selection, Bash found something strange: his team have less than 3 times K Pokenoms! Bash looks carefully at N = 4 Pokenoms he has: ‘Chikapu’: Attack = 100, Defense = 100, Health = 100 ‘Batterfly’: Attack = 10, Defense = 10, Health = 10 ‘Mewthree’: Attack = 200, Defense = 200, Health = 80 ‘Dragonon’: Attack = 150, Defense = 150, Health = 90 When Bash selects Pokenom with K = 1, only ‘Mewthree’ and ‘Chikapu’ are selected! This is because ‘Mewthree’ has highest attack and highest defense! Your task is simple, you are given the stats of all N Pokenoms and the number K. Calculate how many different Pokenoms are there in Bash’s team. Input The first line of input contains 2 integers N and K (1 le K le N le 1, 000). In the next N lines, the i-th line contains 3 integers: A_ i, D_ i and H_ i, representing the 3 stats of the i-th Pokenom. A_ i, D_ i and H_ i are unsigned 32-bit integers. It is guaranteed that no 2 Pokenom have same Attack, no 2 Pokenom have same Defense, and no 2 Pokenoms have same Health. Output Output one line containing exactly one integer: the number of Pokenom in Bash’s team. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 1 100 100 100 10 10 10 200 200 80 150 150 90 2
