Powers of 2 Theta has been learning about powers of 2 in school. She notices that some numbers when written out contain powers of 2 in their digit representation: for instance, 12, 560 contains 256 which is a power of 2. She has been wondering how many such numbers there are. Can you write a program that counts how many numbers contain a given power of 2? Input The input consists of a single line with two integers n and e (0 le n le 15, 000, 000, 0 le e le 25). Output Output a single integer that is equal to the number of distinct integers k (0 le k le n) whose decimal representation contains the digits of 2^ e as a substring. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1000000 1 468559 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 1000000 5 49401 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 1000000 16 20
