Virtual Reality (VR) is one of the new trends for applications recently. Wearing a VR headset, you will be in an immersive virtual environment for education, collaboration, entertainment, etc. To enhance user experience, ICPC establishes a VR room for users to walk and explore a virtual environment. The user can see virtual scenes through a VR headset and can feel the slope of the virtual terrain while walking in this VR room. The floor of this VR room consists of m times n cells in m rows and n columns. The real height of each cell can be adjusted so that we can simulate a virtual terrain. The cell at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column has the real height level S_{i,j} and corresponds to the virtual height H_{i,j} in the virtual scene. The key idea of virtual terrain simulation is to preserve only the relative order of cell heights in each row and each column: In each row i (1 leq i leq m), S_{i,j}=S_{i,k} if H_{i,j} = H_{i,k}, and S_{i,j} > S_{i,k} if H_{i,j} > H_{i,k}. In each column j (1 leq j leq n), S_{i,j} = S_{k,j} if H_{i,j} = H_{k,j}, and S_{i,j} > S_{k,j} if H_{i,j} > H_{k,j}. Given the virtual height of all cells, your task is to determine the minimum number of different real height levels. Input The first line contains two positive integer numbers: m and n, the number of rows and columns in the floor of the VR room respectively (m times n leq 10^6). The i-th line of the following m rows contains n positive integer numbers H_{i,j} (H_{i,j} leq 10^9, the virtual height of cells in the i-th row). Output Display an integer number that is the minimum number of real height levels of cells in the floor of the VR room. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 3 8 12 17 17 20 7 3
