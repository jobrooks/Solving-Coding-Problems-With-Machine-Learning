Given the dimensions of three rectangles, determine if all three can be glued together, touching just on the edges, to form a square. You may rotate the rectangles. For example, Figure 1 shows successful constructions for the first two sample inputs. (1.a) (1.b) Figure 1: Constructions for the first two examples Input The input consists of three lines, with line j containing integers H_ j and W_ j, designating the height and width of a rectangle, such that 100 geq H_ j geq W_ j geq 1, and such that H_1 geq H_2 geq H_3. Output Output a line saying YES if they can be glued together to form a square. Output NO otherwise. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 7 3 7 1 7 3 YES Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 9 2 7 4 7 5 YES Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 3 1 3 2 3 3 NO
