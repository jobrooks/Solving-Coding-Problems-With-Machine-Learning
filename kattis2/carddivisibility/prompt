Since you have learned Modular Arithmetic, you know how to work with quotients and remainders. For every pair of integers a and m with m>0, there exist unique integers q and r such that a = mcdot q+r and 0 leq r < m. But this is a bit simple, you wonder if you can do something more interesting with this theory. Right now, you are holding a handful of consecutive cards numbered from L to R. You lay the cards out side-by-side to create a single large number (i.e. concatenating the digits of your cards). You would like to know the remainder (which is the r in a = mcdot q + r) when this number is divided by 9. For example, L = 9 and R = 11 means you are holding cards 9, 10, 11. Concatenating these numbers produces the number 91011. The remainder r left upon dividing this number by 9 would be r = 3. Input Input consists of a single line containing two integers L (1 leq L leq 10^{12}) and R (L leq R leq 10^{12}). This means you are holding the cards with numbers from L to R, inclusive. Output Display a single line containing the remainder of the concatenated number if you were to divide it by 9.
