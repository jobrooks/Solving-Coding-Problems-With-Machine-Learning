In order to get out of the trap, he must solve the following task with your help. You are given three integers L, D and X. determine the minimal integer N such that L leq N leq D and the sum of its digits is X determine the maximal integer M such that L leq M leq D and the sum of its digits is X Bear will be able to escape from the trap if he correctly determines numbers N and M. The numbers N and M will always exist. Input The first line of input contains the integer L (1 leq L leq 10, 000), the number from the task. The second line of input contains the integer D (1 leq D leq 10, 000, L leq D), the number from the task. The third line of input contains the integer X (1 leq X leq 36), the number from the task. Output The first line of output must contain the integer N from the task. The second line of output must contain the integer M from the task.
