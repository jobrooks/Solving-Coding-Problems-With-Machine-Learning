A Star Battle (of the 2-star variety), also known as “Two Not Touch” as published by The New York Times, is a solitary star-placement puzzle played on a 10times 10 grid. The grid is divided into exactly ten 4-connected regions, and the objective is to place exactly 20 stars in the grid, each in its own cell, such that following conditions are satisfied: Every row, column, and region of the grid contains exactly two stars. No two stars are in adjacent cells, i.e. cells next to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Below is an example of a Star Battle puzzle,1 where regions are delimited by bold lines. The unique solution to this puzzle is shown on the right. Given a description of a Star Battle puzzle and a candidate solution, your task for this problem is to write a program that will determine whether or not the candidate is indeed a valid solution to the puzzle. The input to your program is guaranteed to be a valid Star Battle puzzle with a unique solution. Input The first 10 lines of input contain a description of the Star Battle puzzle. Every line contains exactly 10 digits, where the digit names the region to which its cell belongs. There will be exactly 10 contiguous, 4-connected (i.e. left, right, top, bottom, but not diagonal) regions in the puzzle. The next 10 lines of input contain a description of the candidate solution. Every line contains exactly 10 characters, each a ‘.’ to indicate an empty cell or a ‘*’ to indicate placement of a star. Output If the candidate solution is consistent with all the Star Battle rules for the provided puzzle, output the word “valid” on a single line. Otherwise, output “invalid”.
