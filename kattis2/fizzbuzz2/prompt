A company is hiring a software engineer to a top secret job. After a lot of headhunting they now have N candidates left, denoted 1 to N after anonymization. To test the skills of the candidates, the company has asked them to implement FizzBuzz. A correct implementation of FizzBuzz does the following. For each of the integers 1 to M, if the number is divisible by 3, output “fizz”, if the number is divisible by 5, output “buzz”, if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output “fizzbuzz”, and if the number is divisible by neither 3 and 5, output the number itself. Since the job is top secret, the company cares very much about the right thing being printed in the right place. Your task is to find the candidate whose program outputs the right thing at the right place the most times. Input The first line of the input consists of the integers N (2 leq N leq 1000) and M (2 leq M leq 100), the number of candidates and the number of values their programs should output. The next N lines each contain M strings consisting only of small letters a-z and digits 0-9, separated by a single whitespace. The i’th of these lines contains the output from candidate i. Each of the M strings in the output from a candidate contains at least one character. Output Print the number of the candidate whose output has the most correct things printed in the correct place. In case of a tie, output the candidate with the lowest number. Explanation of sample 1 In the example, the third candidate output the right thing at every place. The other two have at least one incorrect output, so the third candidate has the most correct words. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 15 1 2 fizz 4 5 fizz 7 8 fizz 10 11 fizz 13 14 fizz 1 2 3 4 buzz 6 7 8 9 buzz 11 12 13 14 buzz 1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 3 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 6 fizz fizz fizz fizz buzz fizz 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 2 6 01 is fizz lizzy of norway nr 2 is really buzz lightyear 2
