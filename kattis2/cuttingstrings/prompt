You are given a string s and an integer k. You can remove at most k non-intersecting substrings from s. Your task is to find the alphabetically (i.e., dictionary order) largest resulting string. For example, with string abcdcada and k{=}2, you can choose the substrings [abc]d[ca]da and remove them to get dda. Input Each input will begin with a line with a single integer c (1! le ! c! le ! 2{cdot }10^5), which is the number of cases you must solve. Each of the next c lines will contain an integer k and a string s (1! le ! k! le ! |s|! le ! 10^5, s! in ! [a{-}z]^*), separated by a space. The total length of all strings in the input will be at most 10^6. Output Output the largest string, alphabetically, that you can get by removing k or fewer non-intersecting substrings from s. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 2 abcdcada 1 ababb 2 ababb 1 dadbdcdbdad dda bb bbb ddcdbdad
