This problem has nothing to do with Arithmetic Sequence, but I thought it did, hence the name. Youâ€™re given a sequence a of length n containing only integers. Find the longest subsequence b of a such that for all 3 leq i leq length(b), b[i] = b[i-1] + b[i-2] (Elements of b are enumerated starting from 1). The sequence b is a subsequence of sequence a if b can be obtained from a by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. Input The first line contains a single integer n ( 1 leq n leq 500). The second line contains n integers a_ i ( -10^9 leq a_ i leq 10^9). Output A single integer - the length of the longest subsequence b Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 7 0 3 20 6 20 9 40 4 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 7 36 86 -74 39 -99 71 66 2 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 10 45 -16 -78 -94 -20 -10 -67 100 -30 -40 4
