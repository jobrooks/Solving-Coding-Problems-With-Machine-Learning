Mia is a dice game for two players. Each roll consist of two dice. Mia involves bluffing about what a player has rolled, but in this problem we focus only on its scoring rules. Unlike most other dice games, the score of a roll is not simply the sum of the dice. Instead, a roll is scored as follows: Mia (12 or 21) is always highest. Next come doubles (11, 22, and so on). Ties are broken by value, with 66 being highest. All remaining rolls are sorted such that the highest number comes first, which results in a two-digit number. The value of the roll is the value of that number, e.g. 3 and 4 becomes 43. Player 1 and 2 each roll two dice. You are asked to compute the odds that player 1 will win given partial knowledge of both rolls. Input The input will contain multiple, different test cases. Each test case contains on a single line four symbols s_0  s_1  r_0  r_1 where s_0  s_1 represent the dice rolled by player 1 and r_0  r_1 represents the dice rolled by player 2. A ‘*’ represents that the value is not known, otherwise a digit represents the value of the dice. The input will be terminated by a line containing 4 zeros. Output For each test case output the odds that player 1 will win. If the odds are 0 or 1, output 0 or 1. Otherwise, output the odds in the form a/b where a and b represent the nominator and denominator of a reduced fraction (i.e., in lowest terms). Sample Output Explanation For * * 1 2, the best player 1 can do is tie, so his chance of winning is 0. For 1 2 * *, player 1 wins unless player 2 rolls a Mia, which happens 1 out of 18 times. For 1 2 1 3, 3 1 2 1, and 6 6 6 6 the result is already known. For * 2 2 2, player 1 wins only if she rolls a 1. For * 2 * 6, player 1 wins if he rolls a 1. If he rolls a 2, he wins with probability 5/6. He loses if he rolls a 3, 4, or 5. If he rolls a 6 he wins only if player 2 rolls a 1. Thus, his chance of winning is 1/6 + 5/6 cdot 1/6 + 1/6 cdot 1/6 = 12/36 = 1/3. When no dice are known, Player 1 will win in 615 of all possible 1, 296 outcomes. Player 2 will lose in 615 cases, and there are 66 possible ties. Thus, her chance of winning is 615/1296 = 205/432.
