Modan is playing a new action strategy game, where his goal is to destroy a city. A city is made up of N buildings, where the i-th building initially has health H_ i. At every move, Modan can choose a building to attack, dealing D damage to it. When a buildingâ€™s health falls below or equal to 0, it is destroyed. When the i-th building gets destroyed, it explodes and deals E_ i damage to the adjacent buildings, i.e. the i-1-th and i+1-th buildings, if they exist. Modan is really addicted to the game and wants to know the minimum number of moves he needs to destroy a city. Input The first line contains a single integer T leq 100 giving the number of test cases. Each test case has three lines. On the first line, there are two integers N (1 leq N leq 10, 000), the number of buildings, and D (1 leq D leq 10^9), the amount of damage Modan can do. On the second line, there are N integers, with the i-th integer being H_ i (1 leq H_ i leq 10^9), the initial health of the i-th building. On the third line, there are N integers, with the i-th integer being E_ i (0 leq E_ i leq 10^9), the amount of explosion damage the i-th building does. Output For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of moves needed to destroy the city. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 1 10 33 54 3 10 43 10 59 69 69 69 4 1
