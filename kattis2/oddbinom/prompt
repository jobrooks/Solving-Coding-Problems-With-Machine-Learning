You might be familiar with the binomial coefficient {m choose k} defined as {m choose k} = frac{m!}{k!(m-k)!}, where m and k are non-negative integers and k leq m. Let T_2(n) be the number of odd binomial coefficients such that 0 le k le m < n. The most useful mathematical inequality you will learn during this competition is\[ 0.812556 n^{\log _2 3} \le T_2(n) \le n^{\log _2 3}. \] Emma doesnâ€™t like such imprecise inequalities and would like to calculate T_2(n) exactly. Can you help her? Input The input contains one line with one integer n, 1 leq n le 10^{11}. Output Output one line with the value of T_2(n). Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 9 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 6 15
