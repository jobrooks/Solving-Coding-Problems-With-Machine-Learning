The k^{text {th}} Champernowne word is obtained by writing down the first k positive integers and concatenating them together. For example, the 10^{text {th}} Champernowne word is 12345678910. Given a positive integer n, determine if it is a Champernowne word, and if so, which word. Input The first line contains a single integer, n (1 le n le 10^9). n will not have leading zeroes. Output If n is the k^{text {th}} Champernowne word, output k. Otherwise, output -1. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 123456789 9 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 1000000000 -1 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 11 -1 Sample Input 4 Sample Output 4 1324 -1
