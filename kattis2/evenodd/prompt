Consider the following function f(X), which takes a single positive integer as argument, and returns an integer. function f(X): iterations := 0 while X is not 1: if X is even: divide X by 2 else: add 1 to X add 1 to iterations return iterations It can be shown that for any positive integer X, this function terminates. Given an interval [L, R], compute the sum\[ S = f(L) + f(L+1) + \cdots + f(R-1) + f(R)\enspace . \] Input The first and only line of input contains two integers L and R (1 leq L leq R leq 10^{18}). Output Output the result S modulo the prime 10^9+7. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 127 1083 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 74 74 11
