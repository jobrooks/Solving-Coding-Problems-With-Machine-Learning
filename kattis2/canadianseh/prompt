Fortunately, you have developed a foolproof method to determine which potential suspects are truly Canadian: A person is a true Canadian if and only if they end every sentence exactly with eh? . Given the transcript of a sentence spoken by a suspected spy, write a program to determine if the suspect is truly Canadianâ€¦or merely an imposter in disguise! Input The input consists of a single line, which is the sentence spoken by the suspect. The line will contain between 3 and 100 characters (inclusively). It will also only contain English letters, digits, spaces, and punctuation symbols. Output Display Canadian! if the speaker is a true Canadian following the above criteria, otherwise display Imposter! . Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 The weather is nice, eh? Canadian! Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 I'm Canadian I swear! Imposter! Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 eh? Canadian! Sample Input 4 Sample Output 4 I'm not suspicious, Eh? Imposter!
