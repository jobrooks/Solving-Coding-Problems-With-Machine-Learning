Fermat’s theorem states that for any prime number p and for any integer a ge 0, a^ p equiv a mod{p}. That is, if we raise a to the pth power and divide by p, the remainder is a. Some (but not very many) non-prime values of p, known as base-a pseudoprimes, have this property for some a. (And some, known as Carmichael Numbers, are base-a pseudoprimes for all a.) Given 2 < p le 1, 000, 000, 000 and 1 < a < p, determine whether or not p is a base-a pseudoprime. Input Input contains several test cases followed by a line containing “0 0”. Each test case consists of a line containing p and a. Output For each test case, output “yes” if p is a base-a pseudoprime; otherwise output “no”.
