You have N objects, each with M copies. How many ways are there to take exactly K of them? Two selections of size K are considered different if the K-tuples for those selections are different. So, for example if N=M=K=3 (as in the second sample input), and the N=3 types of objects are labeled A, B, and C, then the tuple (A,B,B) is different than (B,A,B). Input The first line of input contains three integers, N, M and K respectively, subjected to 1 leq N, M, K leq 10^5. Output Output the number of ways. As the number of ways could be large, output them modulo 10^6 + 7. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 10 1 2 45 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 3 3 10 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 3 2 7 0
