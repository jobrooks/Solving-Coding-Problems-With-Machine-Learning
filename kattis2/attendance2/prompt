Taking attendance in your class is a tedious task. You call out the names of students one at a time in alphabetical order. If the student is present, they respond by saying “Present!” before you call the next name. This is such a boring task that you sometimes zone out and don’t keep a proper record of attendance. Write a program to help you summarize the absences! Input The first line of input contains a single integer N (1 leq N leq 200) indicating the number of “callouts”. Then N lines follow indicating the callouts that were made in the order they were made. A single line consists of either a student’s name or of the response Present!. A student’s name will consist of between 2 and 10 characters, the first always being an uppercase letter (’A’-’Z’) and the remaining characters always being lowercase letters (’a’-’z’). The student names will appear in alphabetical order in this input and a line with the response Present! will only appear if the previous line was the name of a student. In particular, the response Present! will never appear as the first callout. Output Output the names of all students that are absent in the order they were called, each on a separate line. If no students were absent, simply output the message No Absences Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 6 Buckley Burnadette Present! Chad Present!
