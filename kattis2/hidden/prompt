Insecure Inc. has decided to shift directions after a failed attempt at developing a new encryption standard. Their new effort is a password system used to hide a password inside another string of characters we denote as a message. However, it is important that the message has a certain property relative to the hidden password. Let us assume that we denote the characters of the password as  c_1 c_2 ldots c_ P (although those characters need not be distinct). To be a valid message for the password, if you start from the beginning of the message and search for any character from the set { c_1, ldots , c_ P } , it must be that c_1 is the first that you find. Subsequently, if you continue looking from that point of the message for any character from the set { c_2, ldots , c_ P } , it must be that c_2 is the next that you find. Continuing in that manner, c_3 must be the next character from the set { c_3, ldots , c_ P} , and so on until reaching c_ P. For example, if the password is ABC, then the string HAPPYBIRTHDAYCACEY is a valid message. Notice that A is the first of the set { A, B, C}  to appear in the message. (The initial H is not relevant.) Following the A that was found, the next occurrence from the set { B, C}  is B. Following the B that was found, the next occurrence from the set { C}  is indeed C. (Note that the A in DAY is not relevant, since we are only looking for a C at this point, and the additional A and C in CACEY are not relevant, because we have already completed the password with the first C.) However, for the password ABC, the string TRAGICBIRTHDAYCACEY is not a valid message. While the A is the first of the set { A, B, C}  to appear in the string, the next occurrence from the set { B, C}  is C rather than B. Also, the string HAPPYBIRTHDAY is not a valid message for the password ABC because the C never appears. As an example with duplicate letters in the password, consider the password SECRET. For this password, the string SOMECHORESARETOUGH is a valid message. In contrast, the string SOMECHEERSARETOUGH is not a valid message, because an extraneous E is found at the point when an R is first expected. Input The input consists of a single line containing two strings. The first string is the password, having length P, with 3 leq P leq 8. The second string has length S, with 10 leq S leq 40. Both strings will consist solely of uppercase letters. (That is, neither string can include whitespace, lowercase letters, digits, or other special characters.) Output Output a single line with the word PASS if the second string is a valid message for the password, or FAIL otherwise.
