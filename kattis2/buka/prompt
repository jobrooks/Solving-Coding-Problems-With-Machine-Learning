Quite often there is substantial noise in the classroom during class. Instead of paying attention to what the teacher is saying, the students rather discuss the economic crisis or Croatia’s joining the European Union. The biggest noise often occurs when the students are idle, so teachers will give them tasks with a lot of work to calm them down. In one type of such task, the student must calculate the result of an arithmetic operation on two large numbers. The arithmetic operations we will consider are adding and multiplication. The operands will be powers of 10 with no more than 100 digits. Write a program that calculates the result of the operation. Input The first line contains a positive integer A, the first operand. The second line either the character ‘+’ or ‘*’, representing addition or multiplication. The third line contains a positive integer B, the second operand. The integers A and B will be powers of 10 and consist of at most 100 digits. Output Output the result of the operation. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1000 * 100 100000 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 10000 + 10 10010 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 10 + 1000 1010 Sample Input 4 Sample Output 4 1 * 1000 1000
