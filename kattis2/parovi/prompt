The distance between two integers is defined as the sum of the absolute result of subtracting their digits. For example, the distance between the numbers 4561 and 3278 is |4 - 3| + |5 - 2| + |6 - 7| + |1 - 8| = 12. If one of the numbers consists of fewer digits than the other, we fill it with leading zeroes. Therefore, the distance between the numbers 32 and 5678 is |0 - 5| + |0 - 6| + |3 - 7| + |2 - 8| = 21. You are given two integers A and B. Calculate the sum of distances between each pair of numbers belonging in the interval [A, B]. Input The first and only line of input contains integers A, B (1 leq A leq B leq 10^{50, 000}). Output The first and only line of output must contain the required number from the text. Given that the number could be extremely large, output the answer modulo 1, 000, 000, 007.
