You have a collection of strings of the same length L and are wondering how similar they are. We can say that the distance d(S,T) between two strings S and T of the same length is the number of indices i where S_ i neq T_ i. For example, d(texttt{berry}, texttt{bears}) = 2 since only the third and fifth characters differ. You wonder if your strings are very close to each other. That is, for a given distance D you have in mind, is there a string S of length L such that d(S,A) leq D for each string A in your collection? Call such a string S a central string. Note that a central string does not necessarily have to be one of your strings. Input The first line of input contains three integers N (1 leq N leq 50), L (1 leq L leq 1, 000, 000), and D (0 leq D leq 6). Here, N indicates the number of strings in your collection, L is the common length of these strings, and D is the distance bound you are curious about. Then N lines follow, the iâ€™th such line contains a single string A_ i of length L consisting of only lowercase letters. You are further guaranteed that N cdot L leq 1, 000, 000. Output Output consists of a single line. If there is a string S consisting of only lowercase letters such that d(S,A_ i) leq D for each 1 leq i leq N, output any such string. Otherwise, simply output the single digit 0 to indicate there is no central string.
