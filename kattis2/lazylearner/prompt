Lang is very lazy at learning English. He is always getting distracted during English classes. Being happy with the sweet message he got from his girlfriend yesterday, Lang invented a game to play during his English class. Lang has an English dictionary containing n words, denoted as T_1, T_2, ldots , T_ n. Denoting as S the message he received, his game is as below: First, he chooses two indices ell  and r (1 leq ell leq r leq |S|). Then, he considers the substring of S from ell  to r, he finds all words in his dictionary which are subsequences of this substring. Next, he sorts all these words in lexicographic order. Finally, he chooses a positive integer k and wonders which is the k-th word of this list. Lang wants to play this game q times. However, he worries that the class would end before he finishes playing, so he asks you to write a program to find the k-th word quickly. Note Given a string S = s_1 s_2 ldots s_ n: The substring of S from ell  to r (1 leq ell leq r leq n) is the string s_ell s_{ell +1} ldots s_ r. A string T = t_1 t_2 ldots t_ m is a subsequence of S iff there exists a sequence of indices 1 leq i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_ m leq n such that S_{i_ j} = T_ j~ forall 1 leq j leq m. A string S = s_1 s_2 ldots s_ n is lexicographically smaller than a string T = t_1 t_2 ldots t_ m iff any of the following is satisfied: n < m and S_ i = T_ i~ forall 1 leq i leq n. There exists an index j such that 1 leq j leq min (m,n), S_ i = T_ i~ forall 1leq i < j and S_ j < T_ j. Input The first line contains a string S of at most 500 lowercase English characters — the message Lang received yesterday. The second line contains two integers n (1 leq n leq 2 cdot 10^4) — the number of words in Lang’s dictionary, and q (1 leq q leq 3 cdot 10^5) — the number of times Lang plays his game. Each of the next n lines contain a non-empty string of lowercase English characters — a word in Lang’s dictionary. The total length of these n words does not exceed 8 cdot 10^4. Each of the last q lines contain three positive integers ell , r, and k (1 leq ell leq r leq |S|, 1 leq k leq n) presenting a game as described above. Output Print q lines describing the words Lang is looking for in these q games. If the length of the word is longer than 10 characters, print only the first 10 characters. If in some game, that word does not exist (i.e, k is greater than the number of words in the list), print ‘NO SUCH WORD’ instead. Please note that the checker of this problem is case-sensitive.
