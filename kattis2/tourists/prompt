In Tree City, there are n tourist attractions uniquely labeled 1 to n. The attractions are connected by a set of n-1 bidirectional roads in such a way that a tourist can get from any attraction to any other using some path of roads. You are a member of the Tree City planning committee. After much research into tourism, your committee has discovered a very interesting fact about tourists: they LOVE number theory! A tourist who visits an attraction with label x will then visit another attraction with label y if y>x and y is a multiple of x. Moreover, if the two attractions are not directly connected by a road the tourist will necessarily visit all of the attractions on the path connecting x and y, even if they arenâ€™t multiples of x. The number of attractions visited includes x and y themselves. Call this the length of a path. Consider this city map: Here are all the paths that tourists might take, with the lengths for each: 1 rightarrow 2=4, 1 rightarrow 3=3, 1 rightarrow 4=2, 1 rightarrow 5=2, 1 rightarrow 6=3, 1 rightarrow 7=4, 1 rightarrow 8=3, 1 rightarrow 9=3, 1 rightarrow 10=2, 2 rightarrow 4=5, 2 rightarrow 6=6, 2 rightarrow 8=2, 2 rightarrow 10=3, 3 rightarrow 6=3, 3 rightarrow 9=3, 4 rightarrow 8=4, 5 rightarrow 10=3 To take advantage of this phenomenon of tourist behavior, the committee would like to determine the number of attractions on paths from an attraction x to an attraction y such that y>x and y is a multiple of x. You are to compute the sum of the lengths of all such paths. For the example above, this is: 4+3+2+2+3+4+3+3+2+5+6+2+3+3+3+4+3=55. Input Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input will consist of an integer n (2 le n le 200, 000) indicating the number of attractions. Each of the following n-1 lines will consist of a pair of space-separated integers i and j (1 le i<j le n), denoting that attraction i and attraction j are directly connected by a road. It is guaranteed that the set of attractions is connected. Output Output a single integer, which is the sum of the lengths of all paths between two attractions x and y such that y>x and y is a multiple of x.
