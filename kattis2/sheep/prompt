David and Martin retired from their jobs and became shepherds. After each winter they need to rebuild the sheep pen. Each year they have a different collection of straight fence segments of various lengths. Naturally, they want to build a sheep pen that covers the largest area. They always spend a lot of time choosing, rearranging, and placing the segments but they are never sure whether they got the optimal solution. Please help them. Input The only input line starts with n, the number of fence segments and then contains a list of n integers, the lengths (in meters) of the fence segments. The lengths are integers between 1 and 100. The number of fence segments n is between 3 and 80. Output The output contains one line with the maximum area (in square meters) of a polygon whose sides have lengths given by the input. Not all segment lengths listed need to be used. Answers with an absolute error of at most 0.005 will be accepted. If no sheep pen can be built, output 0.
