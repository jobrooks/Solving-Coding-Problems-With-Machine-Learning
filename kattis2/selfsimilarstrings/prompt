An object is sometimes called ‘self-similar’ if there are parts of it that are repeated in other places within the same object. Fractals are self-similar mathematical objects, where the similarities occur at different sizes. Here, we’ll consider ‘self-similar strings.’ We’ll say that a string s is self-similar to degree d if all d-length substrings of s occur in at least one other location in s. For example, the string ‘babbabb’ is self-similar to degree 0, degree 1, and degree 2. It is not self-similar to any greater degree. It should be clear that d leq |s|-1. Write a program which determines the largest degree of self-similarity for given strings. Input Input is a list of up to 10000 strings, one per line. Each string is made of up to 80 lower-case alphabet characters (a-z). Input ends at the end of file. Output For each string, print the largest degree to which the string is self-similar. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 abcdefg aaaaaa bababab aaabbbccc 0 5 4 1
