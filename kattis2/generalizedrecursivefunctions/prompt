You have been employed by the math department to find the solutions to different recursive, integer-valued functions. Every function is of the form:\[ f(x,y) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} f(x-a_1,y-b_1)+f(x-a_2,y-b_2)+\ldots +f(x-a_ n,y-b_ n)+c, & \text {if x, y > 0} \\ d, & \text {otherwise} \end{array} \right. \] where all parameters a_ i, b_ i, c, d are non-negative integers, and for each i, a_ i+b_ i > 0. Write a program that, given the parameters, determines the value of the function for various inputs x and y. Input Input starts with an integer 1 le n le 100, indicating the number of cases that follow. Each test case has two lines. The first line is the description 0 to 20 pairs of a_ i and b_ i values, followed by c and d. The second line is a sequence of 1 to 20 pairs of inputs x and y. All inputs are integers in the range [0,99], separated within each line by spaces. Output For each x, y input to the function, output the value f(x,y). Print each output on its own line and separate functions with a blank line.
