Given two strings of lowercase letters, a and b, print the shortest string x of lowercase letters such that exactly one (but not both) of ax or bx is a palindrome; that is, equal to itself when reversed. Input Standard input contains several pairs of a and b (at most 500). Each string is on a separate line and consists of between 0 and 1, 000 lowercase letters. Output For each pair, output a line containing x. If several x satisfy the criteria above, choose the first one in alphabetical order. If no such string x exists, print “No solution.” as answer.
