“Your wish is my command.” ­–Genie (Aladdin). The king of Rectangle Land has just received a royal gift, a stairstep-shaped piece of wood with N steps, from the neighboring kingdom of Stairstep-Shaped Piece of Wood With N Steps Land. The king accepted the gift out of courtesy, but he actually has a disdain for stairstep-shaped pieces of wood with N steps, as it reminds him of the time he fell down the stairs and tore a ligament. He decided to give you, his royal advisor, a royal fiat to divide this stairstep-shaped piece of wood with N steps into more reasonable shapes: rectangles. Figure 1: Illustration of Sample Input 1. Having solved royal problems before, you were able to do this quickly. You realized that this would make a boring problem, so you decided to make it more interesting. Now, you must calculate how many possible ways there are to divide this stairstep-shaped piece of wood with N steps into N axis-aligned, integer-dimension rectangles. Input The first and only line of input contains an integer N (1 leq N leq 100, 000), the number of steps in the stairstep-shaped piece of wood. Output Output a single integer on a line by itself, the number of ways to divide this stairstep-shaped piece of wood with N steps into N rectangles. Since this number can be quite large, you should output only the remainder after dividing this number by 10^9+7. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 14 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 7 429
