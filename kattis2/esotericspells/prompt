SoCCat the Spellcaster is a very magical cat. Currently, SoCCat is learning about combination spells! SoCCat has just learned about combination spells, which are spells that combine two or more spells from different spellcasters to deal more damage. According to the Unified Theory of Magic, if there are k spellcasters casting spells x_1, x_2, ldots , x_ k respectively, then the combination spell will deal damage equal to x_1 oplus x_2 oplus ldots oplus x_ k, where oplus  is the bitwise XOR operation. SoCCat knew of the famous spellcasting group, the n-membered Spellcasters of the Round Table. SoCCat also knew that the i-th member of the group can cast spells 0, 1, 2, ldots , a_ i. Now that SoCCat has learned about combination spells, SoCCat wants to know the maximum damage that can be dealt by the Spellcasters of the Round Table using a combination spell. Help SoCCat calculate the maximum damage! Notes Bitwise XOR of two integers x and y can be computed as follows. Write x and y in base two with the same bit length. Perform the texttt{XOR} operation for each corresponding bit pair: 0 ; texttt{XOR} ; 0 = 0 0 ; texttt{XOR} ; 1 = 1 1 ; texttt{XOR} ; 0 = 1 1 ; texttt{XOR} ; 1 = 0 Convert the texttt{XOR} result back to base ten. As an example, 6 ; texttt{XOR} ; 10 = 12. Because 6 = 0110 and 10=1010 in base two, the bitwise XOR obtained is 1100=12 in base ten. Input The input starts with a line containing an integer C, denoting the number of test cases (1 leq C leq 100). Each test case has the following format. The first line contains an integer n, denoting the number of members in the Spellcasters of the Round Table (1 leq n leq 100). The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ n (0 leq a_ i leq 10^{18}). The i-th integer denotes that the i-th member of the Spellcasters of the Round Table can cast spells 0, 1, 2, ldots , a_ i. Output For each test case, output two lines. The first line of output should contain an integer denoting the maximum damage that can be dealt by the Spellcasters of the Round Table using a combination spell. The next line should contain n integers x_1, x_2, ldots , x_ n, where x_ i is the spell that the i-th member of the Spellcasters of the Round Table should cast for the combination spell to deal the maximum amount of damage (0 leq x_ i leq a_ i). If there are multiple possible answers, output any one of them. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 3 3 7 1 4 3 2 3 3 7 3 5 1 3 3 0 3 3
