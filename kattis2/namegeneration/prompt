Ingrid is the founder and CEO of bicycle retailer BIKEA. The company sells bicycles for customers to assemble themselves. BIKEA has N different bicycles to offer. Ingrid wants to give each of them a human-readable name, to make it easy to remember. But doing this by hand is a very time consuming task. You are given the number N, and your task is to generate N different names. To make the names readable, they must satisfy the following: Each name has length between 3 and 20, and only consists of lowercase English letters. Three consecutive letters of a name cannot all be vowels or consonants. Here we consider a, e, i, o, u vowels, while the remaining 21 letters are consonants. For example, hello, bar, and lkab are all valid names, whereas ingrid, bo and louise are invalid. Input The input consists of one integer N (1 leq N leq 30, 000), the number of names to generate. Output Print N lines, each of them containing a name. It can be proven that it is possible to generate N different names. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 abdullah bjorn nils
