Rhymes are complicated. The extent to which one word rhymes with another depends on how similar they sound; but if they are too similar then they aren’t considered a rhyme at all. Karim has a huge list of N words and wants to determine the maximally rhyming pair of words. To that end he has introduced the concept of rhyme power: Given two words S and T, their rhyme power r(S,T) is defined as 0, if one word is a suffix of the other, the length of their longest common suffix, otherwise. For instance, the rhyme power of “fire” and “desire” is 3, because their longest common suffix “ire” has length 3. In contrast, the rhyme power of “impossible” and “possible” is 0, because “possible” is a suffix of “impossible”. Given Karim’s list of N words, your task is to find the maximum value of r(S, T) over all pairs of words. Input The first line contains an integer N with 2 leq N leq 10^5, the number of words. The following N lines each contain a string S_ i, where 1 leq |S_ i| leq 10^6. The sum of all string lengths |S_ i| is at most 10^6. Output An integer, the maximal rhyme power.
