Do you remember the new art installation from NAC 2020? Well, that artist is at it again, on a grander scale this time, and the new artwork still inspires youâ€”to play a childish game. The art installation consists of a floor with a square matrix of tiles. Each tile holds a single number from 1 to k. You want to play hopscotch on it! You want to start on some tile numbered 1, then hop to a tile numbered 2, then 3, and so on, until you reach a tile numbered k. Instead of the usual Euclidean distance, define the distance between the tile at (x_1,y_1) and the tile at (x_2,y_2) as:\[ \min \left[(x_1-x_2)^2, (y_1-y_2)^2\right] \] You want to hop the shortest total distance overall, using this new distance metric. Note that a path with no hops is still a path, and has length 0. What is the length of the shortest path? Input The first line of input contains two space-separated integers n (1 le n le 500) and k (1le kle n^2), where the art installation consists of an n! times ! n matrix with tiles having numbers from 1 to k. Each of the next n lines contains n space-separated integers x (1 le x le k). These are the numbers in the art installation. Output Output a single integer, which is the total length of the shortest path from any 1 tile to any k tile using our distance metric, or -1 if no such path exists.
