For an undirected, simple graph G = (V, E) we call a subset V’ subseteq V an independent set if no two elements of V’ are connected by an edge. An independent set of G is called a maximum independent set if there is no independent set in G with strictly more vertices. Given a specific kind of connected graph G, find the size of a maximum independent set of G. Input The input starts with one line, containing integers n (1 leq n leq 100), the number of vertices in the graph, and m (n-1 leq m leq n + 15), the number of edges in the graph. Then follow m lines, each containing integers a, b (1 leq a, b leq n) indicating that there is an edge between vertices a and b. The graph given by this input is guaranteed to be both simple and connected: there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices, there are no loops, and there is a path between each pair of vertices. Output Output the number of vertices in a maximum independent set of the input graph. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 1 1 2 1 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 4 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 1 3 2
