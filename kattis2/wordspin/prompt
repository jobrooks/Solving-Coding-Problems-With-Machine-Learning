Å½ofka invented a new word puzzle. She gives you two strings s_1 and s_2 of the same length. You need to modify s_1 into s_2 as quickly as possible. The trick is that you are allowed to modify the strings only using the following types of moves: (1) shift forward where you choose a substring of one of the strings and shift each of its letters by 1 forward in the alphabet, or (2) shift backward where you shift each letter in a substring backward in the alphabet. The first move is not allowed if the substring contains the letter z while the second move is not allowed if the subtring contains a. What is the smallest number of moves you need to modify s_1 into s_2? Input Each word puzzle is described on a single line that contains the strings s_1 and s_2 separated by space. The strings contain only lower case letters. You may also assume that the length of each string is at most 10, 000, 000. Output Output one line with the smallest number of moves needed to modify s_1 into s_2. Note The first sample input can be modified in the following way. First shift lo forward, getting helmp. Then shift h forward 12 times, getting telmp. Then shift l 11 times backward to get teamp and then shift p forward three times to get teams. Total number of moves is 1+12+11+3=27. The second sample input can be modified as follows. First shift the entire string forward, getting bbdddbbbb. Then shift ddd backward twice to get bbbbbbbbb. This requires 1+2=3 moves. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 hello teams 27 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 aacccaaaa bbbbbbbbb 3
