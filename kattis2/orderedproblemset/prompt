You are running a programming contest that features n problems of distinct difficulties. You wish to announce ahead of time that the problems are ordered in such a way that, if the problems are divided into k sections numbered 1 through k, each with exactly frac{n}{k} problems, and problem p is assigned to section leftlceil frac{kp}{n} rightrceil , then for every pair of sections i and j with i < j, every problem in section i is easier than every problem in section j. Note that k must be greater than 1 and be a factor of n. However, you have just sent your problems to the printer so the order cannot be changed. For what values of k would this claim be true? Input The first line of input contains a single integer n (2 le n le 50), which is the number of problems. Each of the next n lines contains a single integer d (1 le d le n). These are the difficulties for the problems in the order that they appear in the problem set. The difficulties are distinct. The problem with difficulty 1 is the easiest problem and the problem with difficulty n is the hardest problem. Output Output a list of integers, one per line. The integers are all valid values of k in increasing order. If no such values exist, output -1. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 6 1 3 2 4 5 6 2 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 6 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 6 6 5 4 3 2 1 -1
