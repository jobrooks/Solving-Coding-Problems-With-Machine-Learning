You are taking a course on machine learning at your university, and as homework you have been tasked with writing a program that can tell vertical bars from horizontal bars in images. To generate some training data, you use the following method. First, take an N times N grid, and fill it with zeros. Next, take a row or a column, and fill it with ones. Finally, take at most N arbitrary cells, and flip them. Flipping a cell means changing a zero to a one, or changing a one to a zero. Generating data this way is easy, but how to generate all the answers? It will take hours to go through the training data manually. If only you had a program that finds all the outputs automatically somehow. You are given an N times N matrix that has been generated as in the description. Write a program that finds whether it was a column or a row that was filled with ones, or if it is impossible to determine. Input The first line of input consists of an integer N (2 leq N leq 1000), the size of the grid. The following N lines each contain a string of length N consisting of zeros and ones. These are the rows of the grid. It is guaranteed that the input was generated by taking a grid of zeros, putting ones on a row or a column, and then flipping at most N cells. Output If the bar was vertical (a column), print “|”. If it was horizontal (a row), print “-”. If it is impossible to determine (because it could be both), print “+”.
