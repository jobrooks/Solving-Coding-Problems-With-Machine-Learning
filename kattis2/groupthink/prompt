A magma is a pair (M,bullet ), where M is a nonempty set and bullet  is a binary operation on M. This means that bullet  maps each ordered pair of elements (x,y) in M to an element in M (in other words, bullet  is a function from M times M to M). The element to which bullet  maps (x,y) is denoted x bullet y. Magmas that satisfy certain properties are given more specialized names. Here are three important properties that (M,bullet ) could satisfy: P1 (associativity): For all x,y,z in M, (x bullet y) bullet z = x bullet (y bullet z). P2 (identity): There is an element I in M such that x bullet I = I bullet x = x for all x in M (I is called an identity). P3 [depends on P2] (inverses): There is an identity I in M, and for every x in M, there exists x^* in M such that x bullet x^* = x^* bullet x = I (x^* is called an inverse of x). A magma that satisfies P1 is called a semigroup. A semigroup that satisfies P2 is called a monoid. A monoid that satisfies P3 is called a group. Given a magma (M,bullet ), determine its most specialized name. Input The input consists of a single test case specifying a magma (M,bullet ). The first line contains an integer n (1 leq n leq 120), the size of M. Assume that the elements of M are indexed 0,1,2,ldots ,n-1. Each of the next n^2 lines contains three integers i~ j~ k (0 leq i,j,k leq n-1), meaning that x bullet y = z, where x is the element indexed by i, y is the element indexed by j, and z is the element indexed by k. Each ordered pair (i,j) will appear exactly once as the first two values on a line. Output The output consists of a single line. Output “group” if (M,bullet ) satisfies P1, P2, and P3. Output “monoid” if (M,bullet ) satisfies P1 and P2, but not P3. Output “semigroup” if (M,bullet ) satisfies P1, but not P2 (and therefore not P3). Otherwise, output “magma”.
