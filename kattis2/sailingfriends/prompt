A common saying goes that if you like sailing, it is much better to have a friend with a boat rather than being the friend with a boat.1 Being mathematically inclined, you have realized that this property applies recursively – it is much better to be the friend of a friend with a boat rather than having a boat, and so on. In a small coastal city, there are N people, of which B already have boats. Among them, M pairs of people are friends with each other. You start to wonder, what is the smallest amount of people who would have to buy a boat so that everyone in the city either owns a boat or could borrow one from a friend (possibly indirectly through a friend of a friend of a …)? Input The first line contains the integers N (1 le N le 100, 000), B (0 le B le N), M (0 le M le 200, 000), as described in the statement. The next line contains B integers – the 1-indexed numbers of everyone with a boat. The final M lines describe the pairs of friends. Each line contains the numbers of two friends 1 le a neq b le N, separated by spaces. Output Output a single integer – the number of additional people who must buy a boat.
