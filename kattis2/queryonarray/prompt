Given an array of integers A_1, A_2, ldots , A_ N and the initial value of all elements are 0. Now you are given M queries, each belongs to one of three following types: 0 x y: Find the sum of all elements from index x to index y modulo 10^9+7 1 x y: Add 1 times 2 times 3 to A_ x, add 2 times 3 times 4 to A_{x+1}, …, add (i+1) times (i + 2) times (i+3) to A_{x+i} and so on until A_ y 2 x y: Subtract 1 times 2 times 3 from A_ x, subtract 2 times 3 times 4 from A_{x+1}, …, subtract (i+1) times (i+2) times (i+3) from A_{x+i} and so on until A_ y Input The first line contains two integers N and M (1 leq N, M leq 10^5) - the size of the array and the number of queries, respectively. Each of the next M lines containts three integers t x y denotes type and range of the query. Output For each query of type 0, print the required answer in a single line. Sample Clarification In the example below: After the first query, the array is [6, 24, 60, 120, 210, 336, 504, 720]. The answer for the second query is 24+60+120+210+336+504+720=1, 974. After the third query, the array is [6, 24, 60, 114, 186, 276, 504, 720]. The answer for the last query is 186+276=462 Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 8 4 1 1 8 0 2 8 2 4 6 0 5 6 1974 462
