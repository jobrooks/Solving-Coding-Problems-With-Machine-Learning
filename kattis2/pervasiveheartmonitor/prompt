You have been hired by a fitness center. You are helping to develop a system to monitor customer heart rate during exercise. While the customer stays in the gym, their heart rate is recorded at 10-minute intervals. When they leave, they can get a report of their average heart rate for the entire visit. Your job is to generate this report. Input Input consists of a series of lines, one for each customer. Customers can scan their ID card when they enter or when they leave, so each line has a customer name either at the start or at the end. Other than the customer name, each line contains a sequence of real values in the range [0, 1000] with at most 2 digits past the decimal representing heart rate measurements throughout the workout. Customer names consists of one of more space-separated words, each consisting of letters A - Z (lower or uppercase). Each customer only appears once in the input. There are at most 25 space-separated tokens (names or numbers) per line. Each token has at most 10 characters. Output For each customer in the order given in the input, print a line with the average of all their heart rate readings, followed by the name. The average heart rate should be accurate within 0.01 beats per minute.
