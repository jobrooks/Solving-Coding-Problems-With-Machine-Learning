A visual representation of the sample input. In an old orchard there is an alley of trees. Unfortunately, at the pace the trees are growing, the alley will become overgrown and the trees will start dying due to a lack of light and competition for nutrients. The ith tree in the alley is positioned d_ i metres from the end of the alley and has a radius r_ i it is going to grow into. If there is no other tree within the radius, the tree will live, otherwise it will die. More precisely, if there is a tree at position d_ j such that d_ i - r_ ileq d_ j leq d_ i + r_ i, then the tree at position d_ i will die. It is clear that some trees need to be cut down to prevent trees from dying. What is the smallest number of trees to cut down in order for all remaining trees to have space to grow and not grow into other remaining trees? Input The first line of input contains a single integer n, where 1leq n leq 5, 000, the initial number of trees. This is followed by n lines each consisting of two space-separated integers d_ i and r_ i, the distance along the alley of the ith tree and the radius required by the ith tree, respectively, where 1leq d_ i leq 1, 000, 000 and 1leq r_ ileq 1, 000, 000. No two trees are in the same position and the distance values are given in strictly increasing order. Output Output a single integer, the smallest number of trees that need to be cut down to allow all remaining trees to grow. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 6 1 3 5 2 7 2 9 3 15 4 18 1 2
