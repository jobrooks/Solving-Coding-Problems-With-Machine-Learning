You travel through a scenic landscape consisting mostly of mountains—there are n landmarks (peaks and valleys) on your path. You pause for breath and wonder: which mountain are you currently seeing on the horizon? Figure 1: Sample 1 Formally: you are given a polygonal chain P_1 P_2 ldots P_ n in the plane. The x coordinates of the points are in strictly increasing order. For each segment P_ i P_{i+1} of this chain, find the smallest index j > i, for which any point of P_ j P_{j+1} is visible from P_ i P_{i+1} (lies strictly above the ray overrightarrow {P_ i P_{i+1}} ). Input The first line of input contains the number of test cases T (1 leq T leq 10). The descriptions of the test cases follow: The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 leq n leq 100, 000)—the number of vertices on the chain. Each of the following n lines contains integer coordinates x_ i, y_ i of the vertex P_ i (0 leq x_1 < x_2 < ldots < x_ n leq 10^9; 0 leq y_ i leq 10^9). Output For each test case, output a single line containing n-1 space-separated integers. These should be the smallest indices of chain segments visible to the right, or 0 when no such segment exists.
