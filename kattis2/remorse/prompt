Morse Code is an assignment of sequences of dots and dashes to alphabet characters. You are to create a Morse-like code that yields the shortest total length to a given message, and return that total length. A dot symbol has length 1. A dash symbol has length 3. The gap between symbols within a character encoding has length 1. The gap between character encodings has length 3. Spaces, punctuation, and alphabetic case are ignored, so the text: The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox. is encoded as though it were just THEQUICKBROWNDOGJUMPSOVERTHELAZYFOX For example, with input ICPC, the answer is 17: Encode the C’s with a single dot, the I with a dash, and the P with two dots, for an encoding of — bullet  bullet bullet  bullet  which has length (3)+3+(1)+3+(1+1+1)+3+(1) = 17. Input The single line of input contains a string s (1 le |s| le 32, 000) of upper-case or lower-case letters, spaces, commas, periods, exclamation points, and/or question marks. Everything but the letters should be ignored. The line will contain at least one letter. Output Output a single integer, which is the length of s when encoded with an optimal reassignment of the sequences of Morse Code.
