Image by Rajesh Misra One day Young Anna comes up with a whimsical idea of using a tree to create a number generator. The generator is created with a modulus m and an internal tree of n nodes numbered from 1 to n. Each tree node is assigned a single digit between 0 to 9. The generator provides a method Get(a, b) that can be used to produce an integer in [0, m). The two arguments a and b specify two tree nodes. The generator walks the path from a to b in the tree, concatenates all the digits along the path (including the digits of node a and b), and obtains a decimal integer v as a result of such digit concatenation. Note that v can be quite large and may contain leading zeroes. The return value of Get(a, b) is v modulo m. Given a tree and the value of m to be used by Annaâ€™s number generator, calculate the return values of q queries Get(a, b). Input The first line of input has three integers n (2 leq n leq 2 cdot 10^5), m (1 leq m leq 10^9), and q (1 leq q leq 2 cdot 10^5). The next n - 1 lines describe the tree edges. Each line has two integers x, y (1 leq x, y leq n) listing an edge connecting node x and node y. It is guaranteed that those edges form a tree. The next n lines each have a single digit between 0 to 9. The ith digit is assigned to node i. The next q lines each have two integers a, b (1 leq a, b leq n) specifying a query Get(a, b). Output For each Get(a, b) query output its return value on a single line. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 100 4 1 2 1 3 1 4 5 3 1 2 3 0 4 1 5 5 1 4 2 3 3 34 31 12 3
