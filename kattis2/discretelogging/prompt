Given a prime P, 2 le P < 2^{31}, an integer B, 2 le B < P, and an integer N, 1 le N < P, compute the discrete logarithm of N, base B, modulo P. That is, find an integer L ge 0 such that\[ B^ L = N \bmod {P}. \] The solution to this problem requires a well known result in number theory that is probably expected of you for Putnam but not ACM competitions. It is Fermat’s theorem that states\[ B^{P-1} = 1 \bmod {P} \] for any prime P and some other (fairly rare) numbers known as base-B pseudoprimes. A rarer subset of the base-B pseudoprimes, known as Carmichael numbers, are pseudoprimes for every base between 2 and P-1. A corollary to Fermat’s theorem is that for any m\[ B^{-m} = B^{P-1-m} \bmod {P} \] Input There are several lines of input (at most 15), each containing P, B, and N separated by a space. Output For each input line, print the logarithm on a separate line. If there are several solutions, print the smallest; if there is none, print “no solution”.
