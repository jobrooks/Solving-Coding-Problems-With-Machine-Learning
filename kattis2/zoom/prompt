To determine whether your company is successful, your boss has to look at a long list of numbers! So many numbers, in fact, that they need some way to simplify the data. You came up with the idea to summarize the list by “zooming out”. How do you zoom out? Just discard everything except every k^{th} number in the list, for some kge 1. Now, you just have to implement the idea, and your company will surely be very successful! Input The first line contains integers n and k, with 1le kle nle 10^5. The second line contains n integers x_1,x_2,dots ,x_ n describing the list of numbers. It is guaranteed that 0le x_ ile 2^{30} for i=1,dots ,n. Output Display the sequence x_{k},x_{2k},dots ,x_{qk} where q=lfloor frac nkrfloor .
