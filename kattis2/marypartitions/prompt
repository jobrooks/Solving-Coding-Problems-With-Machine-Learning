A partition of an integer n is a set of positive integers which sum to n, typically written in descending order. For example: 10 = 4+3+2+1 A partition is m-ary if each term in the partition is a power of m. For example, the 3-ary partitions of 9 are: 9 3+3+3 3+3+1+1+1 3+1+1+1+1+1+1 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 Write a program to find the number of m-ary partitions of an integer n. Input The first line of input contains a single decimal integer P, (1 le P le 1, 000), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed identically and independently. Each data set consists of a single line of input. The line contains the data set number, K, followed by the base of powers, m, (3 le m le 100), followed by a space, followed by the integer, n, (3 le n le 10, 000), for which the number of m-ary partitions is to be found. Output For each data set there is one line of output. The output line contains the data set number, K, a space, and the number of m-ary partitions of n. The result should fit in a 32-bit unsigned integer. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 1 3 9 2 3 47 3 5 123 4 7 4321 5 97 9999 1 5 2 63 3 75 4 144236 5 111
