The festive season is coming and Rectangular City is going to organize N different events for N consecutive days. Rectangular City, as its name suggests, consists of R times C blocks. Each event will be hosted on a rectangular area within the city. In order to lighten-up the events, the mayor decides to spend some of the budgets to decorate K blocks on the condition that every decorated block must be used in all N events. The city council is interested in the number of different ways to organize all N events such that it is possible to choose K different blocks to decorate. Two ways are considered different if there exists a day in which the corresponding event is hosted on a different area. Since the answer can be very large, modulo the output by 1, 000, 000, 007. Input The input contains a line with four integers N, R, C, and K (1 le N le 10^6; 1 le R, C le 5, 000; 1 le K le R cdot C). Output The output contains an integer representing the total number of different ways to organize all events, modulo 1, 000, 000, 007. Explanation In the Sample Input, the city has 2 times 3 blocks, and the mayor decides to decorate 4 blocks for 2 different events (days). There are a total of 7 ways to organize the events. #1 Day 1: oo. Day 2: oo. Decorated: **. oo. oo. **. #2 Day 1: oo. Day 2: ooo Decorated: **. oo. ooo **. #3 Day 1: .oo Day 2: .oo Decorated: .** .oo .oo .** #4 Day 1: .oo Day 2: ooo Decorated: .** .oo ooo .** #5 Day 1: ooo Day 2: oo. Decorated: **. ooo oo. **. #6 Day 1: ooo Day 2: .oo Decorated: .** ooo .oo .** #7 Day 1: ooo Day 2: ooo Decorated: **. ooo ooo **. Note that, in the example above, configuration #7 uses the whole city for both events, thus, the decorated blocks can be any K blocks in the city. The shown decorated blocks are only given as examples. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 2 3 4 7
