A permutation is a list of integers a_1,a_2,dots ,a_ n where every number from 1 to n appears exactly once. We can rotate a permutation a_1,a_2,dots ,a_ n by k to get a new permutation b_1,b_2,dots ,b_ n by moving the first k elements to the end. For example, rotating the permutation 1,3,5,2,4 by 3 yields 2,4,1,3,5. We say that i is fixed if b_ i=i. Given a_1,a_2,dots ,a_ n, determine a rotation amount k that maximizes the number of fixed elements. Input The first line contains an integer n, where 1le nle 10^6. The second line contains n space seperated integers describing a permutation a_1,a_2,dots ,a_ n. Output Output two space separated integers k and f, where k is a non-negative integer which maximizes f, the number of fixed elements of b_1,b_2,dots ,b_ n. If multiple such k exist, you should output the smallest one. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 5 1 2 3 4 1 5 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 11 11 3 8 7 1 2 9 4 5 6 10 4 5
