Alice and Bob play the following game. First, their mother picks a subset of non-negative integers less than 2^{20}. Alice then writes down either 0 or 1 on a piece of paper. Starting with Alice, they now alternate appending either 0 or 1 to the number currently on the paper. Once the paper has 20 digits on it (meaning Bob writes down the last digit), it is converted into binary. If the resulting number is in their motherâ€™s subset, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins. Your task is to determine who would win with optimal play. Since the subset their mother picked can be very large, you are not given all the numbers in it. Instead, you can ask her if different integers are part of the subset. Interactivity This is an interactive problem. Up to 78, 000 times, you can ask if an integer num is in the set by outputting a line containing ? num. After each question, the judge will output a line containing 1 if the number is in the subset or 0 if it is not. If you output too many questions, the judge will exit and your program get wrong answer. At exactly one point, you must output the winner of the game ! winner, where winner is one of alice or bob. Your program must then terminate. There are exactly 114 test cases. Remember to flash the output stream after each question. In C++ this is done with cout << endl; or cout << flush;, and in C with fflush(stdout);.
