The Association for Curtailing Parentheses in Computations is having some trouble. Some members learned in class that a^{b^ c} = a^{(b^ c)}, but others insist that {a^ b}^ c = {(a^ b)}^ c. You are trying to keep the peace by assuring them that it works either way, but you just noticed that {(2^3)}^2 = 64 neq 512 = 2^{(3^2)}. Can you write a program to help the association members focus on what they can all agree on? Input Input consists of three space-separated integers 1 leq a, b, c leq 2 cdot 10^6 on a single line. Output If a^{(b^ c)} = {(a^ b)}^ c, output “What an excellent example!” and if a^{(b^ c)} neq {(a^ b)}^ c output “Oh look, a squirrel!” Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 3 2 Oh look, a squirrel! Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 1 1 1 What an excellent example!
