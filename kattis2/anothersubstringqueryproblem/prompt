You are given a string s and several queries. Each query consists of a string t and an integer k. For each query, determine the k^{th} position in s where a substring matching t starts. If t occurs fewer than k times in s, print -1. Input The first line of input contains a single string s (1 le |s| le 2 cdot 10^5), which is the queriable string. It will consist only of lower-case letters. The next line of input contains a single integer q (1 le q le 2 cdot 10^5), which is the number of queries that follow. Each of the next q lines contains a string t (1 le |t|) and an integer k (1 le k le |s|). This represents a query for the k^{th} occurrence of t in s. The string t will consist only of lower-case letters. The sum of all |t|â€™s will be le 2 cdot 10^5 Output Output a single integer, which is the position of the start of the k^{th} occurrence of t in s, or -1 if t occurs fewer than k times in s. The first character in s is at position 1. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 abacabadabacaba 4 a 7 e 3 bac 2 abada 1 13 -1 10 5
