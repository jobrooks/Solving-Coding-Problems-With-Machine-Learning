Input The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with a line with four non-negative integers, 1 le n le 1000, 0 le m le 5000, 1 le q le 100 and 0 le s < n, separated by single spaces, where n is the numbers of nodes in the graph, m the number of edges, q the number of queries and s the index of the starting node. Nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1. Then follow m lines, each line consisting of three (space-separated) integers u, v and w indicating that there is an edge from u to v in the graph with weight -2000 le w le 2000. Then follow q lines of queries, each consisting of a single non-negative integer, asking for the minimum distance from node s to the node number given on the query line. Input will be terminated by a line containing four zeros, this line should not be processed. Output For each query, output a single line containing the minimum distance from node s to the node specified in the query, the word “Impossible” if there is no path from s to that node, or “-Infinity” if there are arbitrarily short paths from s to that node. For clarity, the sample output has a blank line between the output for different cases.
