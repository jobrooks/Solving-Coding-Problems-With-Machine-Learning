All swathers go through the same basic stages in their construction: for example they all need to have a cutting bar, a grain belt, and a reel fitted. However, these components can be customized based on the buyer’s needs, so these various stages may take different amounts of time between different swathers. N swathers have been ordered and there are M stages in the manufacturing process. The swathers will each go through the same sequence of stages. In particular, the processing occurs as follows: For each swather i and each stage j, it takes P_{i,j} units of time to complete stage j for swather i. The workers at each stage may only work on one swather at a time. At the start of the day all swather orders are ready to be processed by the first stage. At any point in the process, if the workers at stage j are idle and there are swathers waiting to be processed at this stage then the workers will pick the swather that has the lowest label (they are labelled from 1 to N). Note that the work on a stage j can only be started after the work on the stage j-1 is completed. Determine the time each swather is completed. Input There is only one test case in each file. It begins with a single line containing N and M (1 leq N,M leq 1000), the number of swathers and stages (respectively). Following this are N lines, each with M integers. The j’th integer of the i’th line is P_{i,j}, giving the amount of time it will take for the workers at stage j to complete swather i (1 leq P_{i,j} leq 10^6). Output Output a single line containing N integers T_1~ T_2~ ldots ~ T_ n with a single space between consecutive integers. These should be such that stage M for swather i is completed at time T_ i.
