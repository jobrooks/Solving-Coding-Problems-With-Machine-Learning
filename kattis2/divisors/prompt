Your task in this problem is to determine the number of divisors of {n choose k}. Just for fun – or do you need any special reason for such a useful computation? Input The input consists of several instances, at most 11, 000. Each instance consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (0 le k le n le 431), separated by a single space. Output For each instance, output a line containing exactly one integer – the number of distinct divisors of {n choose k}. For the input instances, this number does not exceed 2^{63}-1. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 1 6 3 10 4 2 6 16
