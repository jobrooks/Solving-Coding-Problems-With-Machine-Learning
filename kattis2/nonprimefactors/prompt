In many programming competitions, we are asked to find (or count the number of) Prime Factors of an integer i. This is boring. This time, letâ€™s count the number of Non-Prime Factors of an integer i, denoted as NPF(i). For example, integer 100 has the following nine factors: { 1, underline{2}, 4, underline{5}, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100} . The two which are underlined are prime factors of 100 and the rest are non-prime factors. Therefore, NPF(100) = 7. Input The first line contains an integer Q (1 le Q le 3cdot 10^6) denoting the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contains one integer i (2 leq i leq 2cdot 10^6). Output For each query i, print the value of NPF(i). Warning The I/O files are large. Please use fast I/O methods. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 100 13 12 2018 7 1 4 2
