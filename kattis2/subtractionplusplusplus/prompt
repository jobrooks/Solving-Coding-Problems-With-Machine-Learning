Alex and Steve just got back home from a mining trip and now have a lot of extra cobblestone. With their house already built, they decide to play a game of subtraction. They take turns subtracting from an initial stack of N cobblestone. At a turn i, the player can subtract any amount of cobblestone from 1 to i. For example, the first player who goes must subtract exactly 1 cobblestone and the second player can either subtract 1 or 2 cobblestone. The player who cannot subtract anything loses. Alex always goes first. Will Alex win if she plays optimally? Input The first line consists of 1 integer, 1 leq N leq 200, 000, the initial cobblestone stack size. Output Output “YES” if Alex will win, “NO” if otherwise. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 YES Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 4 YES
