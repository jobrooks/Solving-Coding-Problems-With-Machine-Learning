Image by natareal (CanStockPhoto); Used under license Consider a sequence of 2-dimensional regions in the plane, R_1, R_2, ldots , R_ n, satisfying the following: Each R_ i has one of three shapes: (i) a circle, (ii) a square (with sides parallel to the x-y axes), or (iii) a diamond (a square rotated 45 degrees). Each R_ i is solid, i.e., it includes its interior. For i geq 2, R_ i and R_{i-1} do not have the same shape. For i geq 2, R_ i is inscribed in R_{i-1}. Informally, this means that R_ i fits “snugly” inside R_{i-1}. For the shapes in this problem, this is equivalent to saying that R_ i and R_{i-1} share the same center point, and that R_ i is as large as possible without any point in R_ i lying outside R_{i-1}. Given the shapes of R_1, R_2, ldots , R_ n, and either the area or the perimeter (as specified) of the outermost region (R_1), find either the area or the perimeter (as required) of the innermost region (R_ n). Figure 1: Illustration of Sample Input 1 Input There are three lines of input. The first line contains an integer, n, the number of regions (1 leq n leq 10), followed by a space, followed by a string of length n consisting entirely of characters from {  ‘C’, ‘S’, ‘D’ } , denoting circle, square, and diamond, respectively. These characters specify the shapes of R_1, R_2, ldots , R_ n in the same order (so the first character specifies the shape of R_1, the second character specifies the shape of R_2, etc.). The second line contains a single character, t_1, either ‘A’ or ‘P’, followed by a space, followed by an integer, m (1 leq m leq 200). If t_1 = ‘A’, then m is the area of R_1; if t_1 = ‘P’, then m is the perimeter of R_1. The third line contains a single character, t_ n, either ‘A’ or ‘P’, specifying whether you are required to compute the area or the perimeter of R_ n, respectively. Output Output a single real number that is either the area of R_ n (if t_ n = ‘A’) or the perimeter of R_ n (if t_ n = ‘P’). Your answer will be considered correct if it is within 10^{-6} of the official answer. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 CSD A 12 P 7.817640190446719
