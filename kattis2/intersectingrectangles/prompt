You are given a set of n axis-aligned rectangles in a 2D plane. For this problem, two rectangles are considered to intersect if their boundaries contain any common points (in particular, two nesting rectangles donâ€™t count as intersecting). Determine if some pair of rectangles intersect. In this example, only rectangles A and B intersect. Input Each test case will begin with a line with a single integer n (1! le ! n! le ! 10^5), which is the number of rectangles. Each of the next n lines will contain four space-separated integers: x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2 (-10^9! le ! x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2! le ! 10^9, x_1! <! x_2, y_1! <! y_2), which describe a rectangle, where (x_1,y_1) is the lower left corner and (x_2,y_2) is the upper right corner. All x values will be distinct. All y values will be distinct. Output Output a single integer, which is 1 if some pair of rectangles intersect, 0 if no pair of rectangles intersect.
