The Von Neumann ordinals are a number system. Ordinal numbers can be represented as sets of all numbers less than that number:\[ \begin{aligned} 0 & = \varnothing & =& \ \{ \} \\ 1 & = \{ 0\} & =& \ \{ \{ \} \} \\ 2 & = \{ 0,1\} & =& \ \{ \{ \} ,\{ \{ \} \} \} \\ 3 & = \{ 0,1,2\} & =& \ \{ \{ \} ,\{ \{ \} \} ,\{ \{ \} ,\{ \{ \} \} \} \} \\ & \vdots \end{aligned} \] Input Input consists of a single integer 0 le n le 8. Output The output is the representation of that number as a set as specified above. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 0 {} Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 1 {{}} Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 2 {{},{{}}}
