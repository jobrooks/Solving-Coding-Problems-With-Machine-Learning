Little Mirko is studying the hash function which associates numerical values to words. The function is defined recursively in the following way: f( text {empty word} ) = 0 f( text {word} + text {letter} ) = ( ( f( text {word} ) cdot 33 ) oplus mathrm{ord}( text {letter} ) ) mathbin {% } mathrm{MOD} The function is defined for words that consist of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet. oplus  stands for the bitwise exclusive or operator (i.e. 0110 oplus 1010 = 1100), mathrm{ord}(text {letter}) stands for the ordinal number of the letter in the alphabet (mathrm{ord}(mathtt{a}) = 1, mathrm{ord}(mathtt{z}) = 26) and A mathbin {% } B stands for the remainder of the number A when performing integer division with the number B. mathrm{MOD} will be an integer of the form 2^ M. Some values of the hash function when M = 10: f( mathtt{a} ) = 1 f ( mathtt{aa} ) = 32 f ( mathtt{kit} ) = 438 Mirko wants to find out how many words of the length N there are with the hash value K. Write a programme to help him calculate this number. Input The first line of input contains three integers N, K and M (1 leq N leq 10, 0 leq K < 2^ M, 6 leq M leq 25). Output The first and only line of output must consist of the required number from the task. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 0 10 0 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 1 2 10 1 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 3 16 10 4
