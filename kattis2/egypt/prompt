A long time ago, the Egyptians figured out that a triangle with sides of length 3, 4, and 5 had a right angle as its largest angle. You must determine if other triangles have a similar property. Input Input represents several test cases (at most 1, 000), followed by a line containing 0 0 0. Each test case has three positive integers, at most 30, 000, denoting the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Output For each test case, a line containing “right” if the triangle is a right triangle, and a line containing “wrong” if the triangle is not a right triangle. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 6 8 10 25 52 60 5 12 13 0 0 0 right wrong right
