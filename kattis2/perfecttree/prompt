A graph G is given, which is a tree with N nodes. The nodes are labelled 1, 2, dots , N. Count the number of subgraphs of G which is a perfect k-ary tree. An unrooted tree is called a perfect k-ary tree if it is possible to root the tree such that (1) every non-leaf node has exactly k children and (2) the distance between the root and a leaf is the same for all leaves. For example, the graph in Sample Input contains 6 perfect binary (2-ary) trees, namely { 1} , { 2} , { 3} , { 4} , { 1, 2, 3} , { 2, 3, 4} . Since the answer may be too large, output it modulo 1, 000, 000, 007 (10^9 + 7). Input The first line of input consists of two integers N and k (1 leq N leq 100, 000, 2 leq k leq 5). The following N-1 lines each contain a pair of integers, u_ i and v_ i (1 leq u_ i, v_ i leq N), meaning that there is an edge directly connecting nodes u_ i and v_ i. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. Output Output the required answer on one line. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 2 1 2 2 3 3 4 6
