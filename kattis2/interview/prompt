With the internship season coming up, Johnny has began to prepare for the dreaded technical interviews. Johnny has upcoming interviews with C different companies. The i^textrm {th} company will make Johnny an offer if and only if his technical skill is at least a_ i and business skill is at least b_ i. Furthermore, Johnny knows that his current technical skill is A and his current business skill is B, and that it takes him t_ a minutes to increase his technical skill by 1 and t_ b minutes to increase his business skill by 1 (skill level increase is continuous and linear). Johnny has T minutes to prepare for the interviews. How many offers could he receive at most, assuming he prepares optimally? Input The first line of the input contains five integers A, B, T, t_ a, t_ b, where 0leq A, Bleq 100, 000, 1leq t_ a, t_ bleq 10, and 0leq Tleq 10^9. The next line contains a single integer C, 1leq Cleq 150, 000. The next C lines each contains a pair of integers a_ i and b_ i, 0leq a_ i, b_ ileq 10^9. Output Output a single integer denoting the largest number of offers Johnny will receive assuming he prepares optimally. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 1 7 2 1 3 4 2 2 3 1 5 2
