Roller coasters are so much fun! It seems like everybody who visits the theme park wants to ride the roller coaster. Some people go alone; other people go in groups, and don’t want to board the roller coaster unless they can all go together. And everyone who rides the roller coaster wants to ride again. A ride costs 1 Euro per person; your job is to figure out how much money the roller coaster will make today. The roller coaster can hold k people at once. People queue for it in groups. Groups board the roller coaster, one at a time, until there are no more groups left or there is no room for the next group; then the roller coaster goes, whether it’s full or not. Once the ride is over, all of its passengers re-queue in the same order. The roller coaster will run R times in a day. For example, suppose R=4, k=6, and there are four groups of people with sizes: 1, 4, 2, 1. The first time the roller coaster goes, the first two groups [1, 4] will ride, leaving an empty seat (the group of 2 won’t fit, and the group of 1 can’t go ahead of them). Then they’ll go to the back of the queue, which now looks like 2, 1, 1, 4. The second time, the coaster will hold 4 people: [2, 1, 1]. Now the queue looks like 4, 2, 1, 1. The third time, it will hold 6 people: [4, 2]. Now the queue looks like [1, 1, 4, 2]. Finally, it will hold 6 people: [1, 1, 4]. The roller coaster has made a total of 21 Euros! Input The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow, with each test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: R, k and N. The second line contains N space-separated integers g_ i, each of which is the size of a group that wants to ride. g_{0} is the size of the first group, g_1 is the size of the second group, etc. You may assume that 1 leq T leq 50 and g_ i leq k. Furthermore 1 leq R leq 10^8, 1 leq k leq 10^9, 1 leq N leq 1, 000 and 1 leq g_ i leq 10^7. Output For each test case, output one line containing “Case #x: y”, where x is the case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of Euros made by the roller coaster.
