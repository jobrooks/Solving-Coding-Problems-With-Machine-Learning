In a random digital exponentiation (RDE) cipher, each digit of a number a is raised to a certain power which is determined by a randomly chosen encryption key. The encrypted number is the number that results when each digit is replaced with its power at the corresponding place value. For instance, for a = 243 and an encryption key of 7 4 3, the encrypted value b would be b = 2^7 cdot 10^2 + 4^4 cdot 10 + 3^3 = 15, 387. Given a plaintext value a and an encrypted value b, find the encryption key that was used! Input The input will contain a single test case containing two numbers a and b (0 le a le b le 2, 147, 483, 647). Output Print the encryption key, which is the list of exponents to which each digit in a was raised, separated by spaces, starting from the leftmost digitâ€™s exponent. Each exponent should be a natural number. You are guaranteed that the encryption key exists and is unique. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 243 15387 7 4 3
