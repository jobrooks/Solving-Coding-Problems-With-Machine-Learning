You are a leading programmer at text {Company}^text {TM}, and have been given the following task. Given a list of N integers x_1,ldots , x_ N, is their product x_1cdot x_2 cdot ldots cdot x_ N even? You plug away at the problem using every trick in the book, and come up with a very elegant solution. Lo and behold, your supervisor then informs you that the task has changed! It turns out the higher ups want you to find out if the product x_1 cdot x_2 cdot ldots cdot x_ N is divisible by 2^ K for some integer K geq 0. You just canâ€™t catch a break! Input The input consists of two integers N, K (1 leq N leq 100, 000 and 0 leq K leq 1000). These are followed by N lines, each with a single value x_1,ldots , x_ N respectively (1 leq x_ i leq 10^9 for each 1 leq i leq N) which form the product. Output Display 1 if 2^ K divides x_1cdot x_2 cdot ldots cdot x_ N, otherwise display 0. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 2 3 2 1 1 0 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 5 4 3 30 6 4 7 1
