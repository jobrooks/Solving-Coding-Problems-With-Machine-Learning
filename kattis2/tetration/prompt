Anthony is just now learning basic math, how exciting! He first learns about addition\[ a+n=a+\underbrace{1+1+\cdots +1}_ n, \] then multiplication\[ a\times n=\underbrace{a+a+\cdots +a}_ n, \] exponentiation\[ a^ n=\underbrace{a\times a\times \cdots \times a}_ n. \] and finally, tetration\[ ^ na=\underbrace{a^{a^{\cdot ^{\cdot ^{\cdot ^{a}}}}}}_ n. \] Very quickly, Anthony becomes interested in infinite tetrations, namely\[ ^\infty a={a^{a^{\cdot ^{\cdot ^{\cdot }}}}}. \] Anthony wonders, given an arbitrary real number N, what is the solution to ^infty a=N? Unable to figure it out, Anthony has asked you to write a program to help him! Here’s a fun fact: A solution only exists for frac{1}{e}leq Nleq e. Input The first line of input contains one real number N, 0.36788leq Nleq 2.718281. Output Output a single line containing a real number a, such that ^infty a=N. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn’t exceed 10^{-5}.
