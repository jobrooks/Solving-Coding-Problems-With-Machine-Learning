You have been hired by Hungarian Services to match a list of m problem proposals to a list of n problem topics for a contest, where m geq n. The problem proposals have an index of 1, 2, ldots , m, while the topics have an index of 1, 2, ldots n. Not all problems are suitable for all topics. You will be given r tuples of (a_ i, b_ i, c_ i) denoting that problem proposal b_ i can be matched to topic a_ i with suitability of c_ i. In a valid matching, each topic must be matched to exactly one suitable problem, while each problem can be matched to at most one topic. Alas! it is not always possible to have a valid matching. A partial matching is a valid matching where some of the n topics may be unmatched. Your task is to find the minimum number of unmatched topics among all partial matchings. Among partial matchings that minimize the number of unmatched topics, maximize the sum of suitability of problem proposals to topics within the partial matching. Input The first line contains three integers n, m and r, (1leq n leq m leq 400; 1 leq r leq nm) — the number of topics, the number of problem proposals and the number of suitable pairs of problem proposals and topics. The i^{th} of the following r lines contains three integers a_ i, b_ i, c_ i, (1 leq a_ i leq n, 1 leq b_ i leq m, 1 leq c_ i leq 10), where problem b_ i can be matched to topic a_ i with suitability c_ i. It is guaranteed that all (a_ i, b_ i) pairs are unique. Output Output two integers — the minimum number of unmatched topics, and the maximum sum of suitability of problem proposals to topics within the partial matching.
