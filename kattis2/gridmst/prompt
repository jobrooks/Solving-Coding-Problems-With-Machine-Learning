This is a very simple problem. You are given N points. Some points may be repeated. The weight (distance) between two points is given by the Manhattan distance between the two points. Find the weight of a Minimum Spanning Tree that spans these N points. Input The input consists of: One line with one integer N (1 leq N leq 100, 000), the number of points, N lines each with two integers x and y (0 leq x,y < 1, 000), the coordinates of each point. Output Output one line with a single integer: The weight of a Minimum Spanning Tree that spans these N points.
