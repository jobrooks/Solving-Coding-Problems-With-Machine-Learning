Given diagonal corners of a rectangle with sides parallel to the X and Y axes, compute the area of the rectangle. Input The single line of input contains four real numbers x1, y1, x2 and y2 (|x1|,|y1|,|x2|,|y2| le 100.0), where (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are diagonal corners of a rectangle with sides parallel to the X and Y axes. The rectangle is guaranteed to have an area greater than 0.01. Output Output a single line with a single real number, which is the area of the given rectangle. This number must be accurate to within 10^{-2} absolute or relative error. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 0.0 0.0 3.0 4.0 12.000 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 5.2 -4.64 -3.47 2.2 59.303
