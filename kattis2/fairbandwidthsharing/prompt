Orange tabby cat. Dreaming of revolutionizing the tech industry and making the world a better place, Ging has recently moved to Silicon Valley to found his own startup, Katbook. Katbook allows users to download cat pictures. Katbook is capable of transferring t bits per second. There are n species of cats, numbered from 1 to n. There is a demand ratio d_ i for the pictures of the i-th species. This means, if there is no further restrictions, the i-th cat species should have a ‘fair share’ of frac{d_ i}{sum _{j=1}^{n} d_ j} fraction of the total bandwidth t. However, because of infrastructure limitations, the bandwidth for the i-th species must be between a_ i and b_ i. You are newly hired by Ging as a network engineer at Katbook. Your first task is to find the most ‘fair’ bandwidth allocation satisfying the above constraints. More formally, let x_ i be the bandwidth allocated for downloading pictures of the i-th species. You must find x_ i such that: a_ i le x_ i le b_ i, sum _{i=1}^{n} x_ i = t, Let y_ i = t cdot frac{d_ i}{sum _{j=1}^{n} d_ j} (y_ i is the ‘fair share’ bandwidth, if there was no constraints regarding a_ i and b_ i), the value sum _{i=1}^{n} frac{(x_ i - y_ i)^2}{y_ i} should be as small as possible. Input The first line of input contains 2 integers n and t (1 le n le 10^5, 1 le t le 10^6). In the next n lines, the i-th line contains 3 integers a_ i, b_ i and d_ i (0 le a_ i le b_ i le 10^6, 0 < b_ i, 1 le d_ i le 10^6). It is guaranteed that there exists at least one valid solution. It can be shown that under these constraints, the solution is unique. Output Output n lines, each line contains the allocation for downloading pictures of the i-th species. The answer will be accepted if and only if its relative or absolute error to the optimal solution is at most 10^{-6}. Formally, for each line, let your answer be a, and the jury’s answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if frac{|a - b|}{max {(1, |b|)}} le 10^{-6}. Explanation of Sample input In the first sample, each cat species has its ‘fair share’ of frac{1}{3} of the whole bandwidth. In the second sample, note that the cat species 1 has much more demand and could get almost all of the available bandwidth if not for its maximum to be capped at 1. The rest is divided with ratio 2:1, hence the cat species 2 gets 6 bits per second and the cat species 3 gets 3 bits per second.
