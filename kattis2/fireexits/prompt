The local museum is facing a huge problem. After years of expansion it now holds a large number of exhibition halls. The halls are connected pairwise by a number of two-way corridors, such that there is exactly one sequence of corridors leading from the entrance to each hall. During this expansion it has failed to keep up with local fire regulations. Indeed, there are no fire exits at all! The regulations state that there must be fire exits placed in a subset of halls such that from any hall, you must pass no more than D corridors. Thereâ€™s a cost associated with building a fire exit, which is different for each hall. How much does the museum need to pay to build all the fire exits? Input The first line contains the integers N (1 le N le 1, 000), the number of exhibition halls, and D (0 le D le N), the maximum distance to a fire exit. The next line contains N integers, the costs for building an exit for halls 1, 2, dots . Each cost is between 1 and 10^6. The next N - 1 lines describe the corridors connecting the halls. Each corridor is described by two integers 1 le a neq b le N, the numbers of the two halls the corridor connects. Output Output the smallest cost to build the required fire exits.
