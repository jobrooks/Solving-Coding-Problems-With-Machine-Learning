Consider a polynomial f(x) like the one plotted below. For sufficiently small (large negative magnitude) values of x, the function f(x) has a negative value. As x gets larger (more positive), f(x) become positive, then negative again, then positive again. We could describe the left-to-right behavior of this curve with the string “-+-+”. For curves like this, we say the sign profile is a string of + and - characters. If lim _{x rightarrow -infty } f(x) < 0, the string starts with -. Otherwise, it starts with +. Each time the curve crosses the X axis, we append another character to the string that has the opposite sign of its predecessor. Thus, the sign profile is a sequence of alternating + and - characters that describes the sign of the curve from left to right. If lim _{x rightarrow infty } f(x) < 0, the string ends with -. Otherwise it ends with +. Input Input consists of up to 100 test cases, one per line. Each test case consists of four real numbers, c_0, c_1, c_2 and c_3, some of which may be zero. Each is in the range [-100,100] with at most 8 digits past the decimal point. These values give the coefficients of a polynomial f( x ) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3. The end of input is marked with values of zero for all coefficients. The input data will be such that the answer will not change if any of the non-zero coefficients are changed by 10^{-6} or less. Output For each test case, print out a line giving the sign profile of f(x). Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 -1 -3 4 -1 -1 0 -5 5 -0.2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 +-+- -+ +-+
