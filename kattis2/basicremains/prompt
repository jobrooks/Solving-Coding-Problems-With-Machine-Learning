Given a base b and two non-negative base-b integers p and m, compute p bmod m and print the result as a base b integer. p bmod m is defined as the smallest non-negative integer k such that p = am + k for some integer a. Input Input consists of a number of cases (at most 1000). Each case is represented by a line containing three non-negative integers. The first, b, is a base-10 number between 2 and 10. The second, p, contains up to 1000 digits between 0 and b-1. The third, m, contains up to 9 digits between 0 and b-1. The last case is followed by a line containing 0. Output For each test case, print a line giving p bmod m as a base-b integer. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 1100 101 10 123456789123456789123456789 1000 0 10 789
