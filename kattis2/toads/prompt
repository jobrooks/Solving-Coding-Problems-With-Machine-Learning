Toads in their pipes There are N Toads in the Mushroom Kingdom, and they have been tasked with building a network of pipes between their houses to facilitate quick travel throughout the kingdom. Each Toad i (numbered from 1 to N) chooses another Toad j neq i and builds a pipe connecting their houses bidirectionally; this pipe takes t_ i time to cross in either direction. Captain Toad wants all Toads to be able to reach each other quickly enough, so he might build a few additional pipes between various pairs of houses. After all pipes are built, Captain Toad wants to check how quickly Toads can travel between houses, so he asks you Q queries consisting of two Toads a and b. For each query, you must figure out the minimum time required to go from Toad a’s house to Toad b’s house. Input The first line of input contains a single integer N (2 leq N leq 10^5), the number of Toads. N lines follow representing each Toad’s pipe. The i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers j (1 leq j leq N, j neq i) and t_ i (1 leq t_ i leq 10^9), representing that Toad i’s pipe connects their house to Toad j’s house and takes t_ i time to cross. The next line contains a single integer L (0 leq L leq 7), representing the number of additional pipes built by Captain Toad. The next L lines each contain three space-separated integers x,y,t (1 leq x,y leq N, x neq y, 1 leq t leq 10^9), representing a pipe built by Captain Toad between Toad x’s house and Toad y’s house that takes t time to cross in either direction. It is possible that Captain Toad builds a pipe between two houses that already had a pipe between them (the new pipe may even take longer to cross), but he will not build multiple pipes between the same two houses. The next line of input contains a single integer Q (1 leq Q leq 10^5), the number of queries. Finally, Q lines follow representing each of Captain Toad’s queries. Each line contains two space-separated integers a and b (1 leq a,b leq N, a neq b), representing the two Toads for each query. Output Output Q lines representing the answers to the queries: for each query, output the minimum time required to go from one house to the other, or -1 if there is no path between the two houses.
