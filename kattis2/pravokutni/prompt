N points are placed in the coordinate plane. Write a program which calculates in how many ways a right triangle can be formed by three of the given points. A right triangle is one in which one of the angles is 90 degrees. Input The first line of input contains an integer N (3 le N le 1500), the number of points. Each of the following N lines contains the coordinates of one point, two integers separated by a space. The coordinates will be between -10^9 and 10^9. No two points will be located at the same coordinates. Output Output the number of right triangles.
