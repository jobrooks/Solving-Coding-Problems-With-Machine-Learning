Jimmy is performing in ByteLand today! Anthony the Ant is a huge fan of Jimmy’s music, so he can’t wait to get to the concert. ByteLand consists of of N intersections and M roads. Every road is bidirectional and connects two distinct intersections. Anthony is currently on intersection s and the concert is being held at intersection t. Anthony must get to the concert in T seconds and he can travel at 1 meter/second. Unfortunately for Anthony, he has a huge fear of spiders and ByteLand is full of spiders. Spiders reside at certain intersections in ByteLand. Anthony will choose a path from s to t that maximizes D, the minimum distance between any intersection on the path and any spider, such that the path can be travelled in no more than T seconds. Input The first line contains three integers N (2leq Nleq 100, 000), M (1leq Mleq min (200, 000, n(n-1)/2)), and T (1leq Tleq 10^9). Each of the next M lines specify the roads. A road is described by three integers u, v (0leq u, vleq N-1 and uneq v) and d (1leq dleq 10, 000), which means that a d meters long road connects intersections u and v. It is guaranteed that at most one road connect any two intersections, and that there exists a path between any two intersections. The next line contains s, t (0leq s, tleq N-1 and sneq t, representing Anthony’s current location and the location of the concert. You may assume Anthony can always travel from s to t in no more than T seconds. The last line contains a integer 1leq Kleq N, denoting the number of intersections occupied by spiders, followed by K integers 0leq a_ ileq N-1 denoting the intersections with spiders. Output Print the maximum D (as defined earlier) for the path Anthony takes.
