Input There are several test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers n, t, where 1 leq n leq 10^{18}, and 0 leq t leq 100. Then follow t operations to perform, each of the form x mbox{op} y. Here, 0 leq x, y < n are integers, and op is one of ’+’, ’-’, ’*’, ’/’, indicating an operation to perform. Division, x / y is defined to be xy^{-1}. Input is terminated by a case where n = 0 and t = 0, which should not be processed. Output For each operation in each test case, output the result of performing the indicated operation modulo n. If the operations is not possible (e.g. because of division by zero), output -1.
