SoCCat the Cat King is a very fair cat. Currently, SoCCat wants to ensure all cats can live in peace and harmony! The Cat Kingdom is a very large kingdom, with n cats living in it. The cats are numbered from 1 to n. King SoCCat has noticed a glaring problem in the kingdom — the uneven distribution of wealth among the cats. To solve this problem, King SoCCat has decreed that wealthy cats should give some of their wealth to poorer cats — to ensure that all cats can live in peace and harmony. After surveying each cat in the kingdom, King SoCCat has determined that: Cat i has w_ i units of wealth. Cat i is not willing to have less than l_ i (l_ i leq w_ i) units of wealth. As a fair king, SoCCat wants to ensure that all cats have at least l_ i units of wealth, and the poorest cat has the maximum possible wealth. To achieve this, King SoCCat can do the following any number of times: Choose a cat i with wealth strictly greater than l_ i. Choose any other cat j, and give 1 unit of wealth from cat i to cat j. Unfortunately, King SoCCat is not very good at math. Therefore, as a friend of the Cat Kingdom, help King SoCCat! Input The input starts with a line containing an integer C, denoting the number of test cases (1 leq C leq 300, 000). Each test case has the following format. The first line contains an integer n, denoting the number of cats in the kingdom (1 leq n leq 300, 000). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 300, 000. The second line contains n integers w_1, w_2, ldots , w_ n, denoting the wealth of each cat (1 leq w_ i leq 10^9). The third line contains n integers l_1, l_2, ldots , l_ n, denoting the minimum wealth that each cat is willing to have (1 leq l_ i leq w_ i). Output For each test case, output a line containing a single integer denoting the maximum possible wealth that the poorest cat can have, if King SoCCat distributes the wealth of the cats in the kingdom fairly and optimally.
