Input The first line of input contains a line contains a line with four non-negative integers, 2 le n le 250, 0 le m le 5, 000, 0 le s le n-1 and 0 le t le n-1, separated by single spaces, where n is the numbers of nodes in the graph, m is the number of edges, s is the source and t is the sink (s ne t). Nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1. Then follow m lines, each line consisting of four (space-separated) integers u, v, c and w indicating that there is an edge from u to v in the graph with capacity 1 le c le 10, 000 and cost 1 le w le 1, 000. Output Output a single line containing two integers; the size F of a maximum flow from node s to node t, and the cost of a mimimum cost flow of size F. You may assume that F < 2^{31}.
