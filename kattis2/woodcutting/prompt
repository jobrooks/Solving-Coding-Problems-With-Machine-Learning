Yraglac recently decided to get into the wood cutting business, and now has N customers who would like to have their wood cut. A piece of wood of size s takes s time units to cut, and Yraglac can only cut a single piece of wood at a time. To maximize customer happiness, Yraglac would like to minimize the average total time a customer has to wait to have all of their wood pieces cut. Can you help him? Input The first line contains a single integer T leq 10 giving the number of test cases. Each test case begins with an integer N (1leq N leq 10^5), the number of customers. N lines follow, where the ith line begins with an integer W_ i (1 leq W_ i leq 10^5), the number of wood pieces that customer i would like to have cut, followed by W_ i integers, the sizes of the wood pieces of the customer. Each wood piece has a size between 1 and 1, 000 inclusive. The total number of wood pieces will not exceed 10^5. Output For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum average total time a customer will wait to have all of their wood pieces cut. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesnâ€™t exceed 10^{-6}. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 1 2 7 5 2 1 7 1 5 12.0000000000 8.5000000000
