You are given a sequence, in the form of a string with characters ‘0’, ‘1’, and ‘?’ only. Suppose there are k ‘?’s. Then there are 2^ k ways to replace each ‘?’ by a ‘0’ or a ‘1’, giving 2^ k different 0-1 sequences (0-1 sequences are sequences with only zeroes and ones). For each 0-1 sequence, define its number of inversions as the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to sort the sequence in non-decreasing order. In this problem, the sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order precisely when all the zeroes occur before all the ones. For example, the sequence 11010 has 5 inversions. We can sort it by the following moves: 11010 rightarrow  11001 rightarrow  10101 rightarrow  01101 rightarrow  01011 rightarrow  00111. Find the sum of the number of inversions of the 2^ k sequences, modulo 1, 000, 000, 007 (10^9 + 7). Input The first and only line of input contains the input string, consisting of characters ‘0’, ‘1’, and ‘?’ only, and the input string has between 1 to 500, 000 characters, inclusive. Output Output an integer indicating the aforementioned number of inversions modulo 1, 000, 000, 007. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 ?0? 3
