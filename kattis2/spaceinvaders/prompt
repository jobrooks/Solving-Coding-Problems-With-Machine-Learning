The aliens from outer space have (finally!) invaded Earth. Defend yourself, or be disintegrated! Or assimilated. Or eaten. We are not yet sure. The aliens follow a known attack pattern. There are n attackers, the i-th one appears at time a_ i, at distance d_ i from you. He must be destroyed no later than at time b_ i, or else he will fire his weapon, which will definitely end the fight. Your weapon is an area-blaster, which can be set to any given power. If fired with power R, it momentarily destroys all aliens at distance R or smaller. It also consumes R fuel cells. Determine the minimal cost (measured in fuel cells) of destroying all the aliens, without being killed. Input The first line of input contains the number of test cases T (1 leq T leq 5). The descriptions of the test cases follow: Each test case starts with a line containing the number of aliens n (1 leq n leq 300). Of the next n lines, the i-th one contains three integers a_ i, b_ i, d_ i, (1 leq a_ i < b_ i leq 10, 000; 1 leq d_ i leq 10, 000). The i-th alien appears at time a_ i, is idle until b_ i, and his distance from you is d_ i. Output For each test case, output one line containing the minimum number of cells needed to destroy all the aliens. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 3 1 4 4 4 7 5 3 4 7 7
