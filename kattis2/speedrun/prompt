You aspire to become a top Minecraft survival speedrunner. So, you need to come up with a strategy to do every necessary task quickly and efficiently. After watching a lot of previous world record speedruns, you noticed that the first day is the most crucial. You need to finish at least G tasks on the first Minecraft day for the speedrun to succeed. Each Minecraft day is 24, 000 ticks long, and thus to be a true gamer, you decided to do your math in Minecraft lingo. You can only work on one task at a time, and you cannot start another task before finishing your current task. Each task can only be done in a specific period of time 0 leq t_{start} < t_{end} leq 24, 000. Note: so long as the starting time of a task is greater than or equal to the end time of the previous task, the task can be scheduled with no conflict. Given G, the minimum number of tasks you need to do on the first Minecraft day; N, the number of possible tasks you can do, and their corresponding time period, determine whether this run can be successful. Input The first line consists of 2 space-separated integers, 0 < G leq N < 10^5, the number of tasks you need to do on the first day and the total number of tasks. The next N lines each consist of 2 integers t_{start} and t_{end}, where 0 leq t_{start} < t_{end} leq 24, 000. Output Output “YES” if the run can be potentially successful, and “NO” otherwise. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 3 0 20 20 24000 19 21 YES Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 2 4 3 5 1 4 4 24000 0 17000 YES Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 3 4 1 501 500 1001 1000 1501 1500 2000 NO
