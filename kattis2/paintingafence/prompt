You need to hire some people to paint a fence. The fence is composed of 10, 000 contiguous sections, numbered from 1 to 10, 000. You get some offers from painters to help paint the fence. Each painter offers to paint a contiguous subset of fence sections in a particular color. You need to accept a set of the offers, such that: Each section of the fence is painted. At most 3 colors are used to paint the fence. If it is possible to satisfy these two requirements, find the minimum number of offers that you must accept. Input The first line of input contains an integer N, the number of offers. Then follow N lines, one for each offer, each containing “C A B” where C is the color, which is an uppercase string of up to 10 letters, A is the first section and B is the last section to be painted. 1 leq A leq B leq 10, 000. You may assume that 1 leq N leq 300. Output Output one line containing the number of offers that need to be accepted, or “IMPOSSIBLE” if there is no acceptable set of offers.
