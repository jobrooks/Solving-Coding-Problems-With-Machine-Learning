Consider a positive integer x. Multiply its nonzero digits and you get another integer y. Repeating this process, you eventually arrive at a single digit between 1 and 9. Write a program that reads x and outputs the resulting digit. Input An integer x with 10 leq x leq 1, 000. Output Print a digit between 1 and 9, the result of repeatedly multiplying the nonzero digits of x as described above. Explanation of Sample Inputs In Sample Input 1, we have x = 808. Multiplying 8 and 8, we arrive at 64. Then we get 6 cdot 4 = 24, and finally 2 cdot 4 = 8, which is the sample output. In Sample Input 2, there is only a single nonzero digit, 2. The product of all digits in a set containing only a single element is the digit itself. Thus the answer is 2. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 808 8 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 20 2
