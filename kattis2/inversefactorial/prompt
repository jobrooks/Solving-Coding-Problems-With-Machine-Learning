Photo by Ginette A factorial n! of a positive integer n is defined as the product of all positive integers smaller than or equal to n. For example,\[ 21! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot 21 = 51\, 090\, 942\, 171\, 709\, 440\, 000. \] It is straightforward to calculate the factorial of a small integer, and you have probably done it many times before. In this problem, however, your task is reversed. You are given the value of n! and you have to find the value of n. Input The input contains the factorial n! of a positive integer n. The number of digits of n! is at most 10^{6}. Output Output the value of n.
