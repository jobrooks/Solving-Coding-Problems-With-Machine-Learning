Alice and Bob engage in a strategic duel called Number Magic, where Alice initially chooses a positive integer N called the starting number. The game permits two specific magic operations to be performed on a positive integer K: Say K has D digits. One operation is to add the number consisting of D 1-digits (i.e. sum _{j=0}^{D-1} 10^ j) to K. For example, if K = 93091 then this magic operation would add 11111 to K resulting in 104202; if K = 99 then it becomes 110; if K = 9 it becomes 10. If K > 1, one operation is to divide K by 2 and round down. For example, if K = 2 then it becomes 1, if K = 13 it becomes 6. There are Q rounds of the duel. In round i, Bob picks a target number M_ i and the Alice must determine if it is possible to apply at most 32 magic operations to the starting number N in order to reach M_ i. That is, Alice should find a sequence N_0, N_1, N_2, ldots , N_ k with k leq 32 such that N_0 = N and N_ i can be obtained by applying a magic operation to N_{i-1} for each 1 leq i leq k? Note, only M_ i will change between rounds: N will be the same in each round. This is a very challenging game, Alice has asked you for help! Input The first line of input contains two space integers, N (1 leq N leq 10^{16}) and Q (1 leq Q leq 1000) where N is the starting number that Alice chooses and Q is the number of rounds. Then Q lines follow, the iâ€™th such line containing a single integer M_ i (1 leq M_ i leq 10^{16}) indicating the target number that Bob chooses for round i Output Output Q lines where line i contains the text YES if it is possible to transform N into M_ i using at most 32 applications of magic, otherwise line i contains the text NO.
