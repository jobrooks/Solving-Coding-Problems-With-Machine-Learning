A student wants to send to his friend a message, which is a text string p consisting of only lowercase latin alphabet letters. To encrypt his message, he creates a lowercase alphabet string h of size n that contains p as a substring. The student is curious to find out how many different ways there are to create such a string h. Given two positive integers n and M and a string p consisting of only lowercase latin alphabet letters, letâ€™s denote K to be the total number of different ways to create a lowercase alphabet string h of size n such that p is a substring of h. Your task is to find the remainder of K divided by M. Input The input consists of several datasets. The first line of the input contains the number of datasets which is a positive integer and is not greater than 20. The following lines describe the datasets. Each dataset is described by the following lines: The first line contains two positive integers n and M, where n leq {10}^{12} and M leq {10}^{12}); The next line contains the text string p consisting of at most 50 lowercase latin alphabet letters. Output For each dataset, output the remainder of K divided by M. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 2 100 ab 3 100 ab 1 52
