A googol written out in decimal has 101 digits. A googolplex has one plus a googol digits. Thatâ€™s a lot of digits! Given any number x_{0}, define a sequence using the following recurrence:\[ x_{i+1} = \text {the number of digits in the decimal representation of }x_{i} \] Your task is to determine the smallest positive i such that x_{i} = x_{i-1}. Input Input consists of several lines. Each line contains a value of x_{0}. Every value of x_{0} is non-negative and has no more than one million digits. The last line of input contains the word END. There are at most 10, 000 values of x_0 and the size of the input file is at most 2 MB. Output For each value of x_0, output the corresponding value of i. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 42 5 END 3 2
