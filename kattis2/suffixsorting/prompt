Input The input consists of less than 10 test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing a non-empty string s, of length at most 100, 000. Then follows a line containing an integer n followed by n integers q_1, ldots , q_ n, where 0 le q_{i} < operatorname {length}(s), each indicating a query. Output For each test case, output a line containing n integers p_{1}, ldots , p_{n}, where p_{i} is the starting position of the q_{i}â€™th smallest suffix of s.
