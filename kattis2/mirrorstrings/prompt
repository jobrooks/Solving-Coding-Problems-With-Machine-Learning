A character is called a “mirror character” if it looks the same when flipped up and down, and the same when flipped left and right. The uppercase mirror characters, H, I, O, X. The lowercase mirror characters are l (since people often write this as a vertical line), o, and x. In the same way, a string that looks the same when flipped up and down or when flipped left and right is called a “mirror string”. For example, XXOOOOXX is a mirror string. The height of the character affects the construction of the mirror string. For example, llll and oooo are both mirror strings. However, lool is not a mirror string because it looks different when it is flipped up and down. The uppercase characters H, I, O, X and the lowercase character l are both of height 2 while the lowercase letters x and o are of height 1. Tommy wants to construct mirror strings with lower characters and upper characters. He wants to know how many different mirror strings have length in the range [L, R] (i.e. how many mirror strings have a length m satisfying L leq m leq R). For example, the 7 mirror strings of length 1 are H, I, O, X, l, o, or x. There are also 7 mirror strings of length 2, namely HH, II, OO, XX, ll, oo, and xx. But there are many more mirror strings of bigger lengths, for example there are 29 mirror strings of length 3. Input The first and only line of input contains two integers L and R (1 leq L leq R leq 10^6), indicating the range of the lengths of mirror strings that Tommy wants to count. Output Output the number of mirror strings that have a length m satisfing L leq m leq R. Since there can be many such strings, you should output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 (i.e. the remainder of the answer when it is divided by 10^9 + 7).
