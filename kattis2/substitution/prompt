A substitution cipher uses a substitution table that for each letter x in the alphabet assigns another (possibly the same) letter p[x] in the same alphabet. A message m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4 is then encrypted as E_ p(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4)=p[m_1], p[m_2], p[m_3], p[m_4]. This only works if p is one-to-one. That is, p has the property that p[x] = p[x’] only if x=x’. Now consider the idea of iterating this, i.e., to encrypt the encryption by applying the substitution table again. We can therefore define substitution to the power k, denoted E^ k_ p() by\begin{eqnarray*} E^0_ p(m_1\ldots m_\ell ) & = & m_1\ldots m_\ell \\ E^{k+1}_ p(m_1\ldots m_\ell ) & = & E_ p(E^ k_ p(m_1\ldots m_\ell )) \end{eqnarray*} Now, given m_1ldots m_ell , c_1ldots c_ell , and p[], we might ask (and we will!) for a k such that E_ p^ k(m_1ldots m_ell ) = c_1ldots c_ell . In our case the alphabet will have 100 symbols denoted 1, 2,ldots , 100. You will be given a message, m, a cryptotext, c, and a substitution table, p. You are to find a k such that E^ k_ p(c)=d. Specifically, we want such a k in the interval 0leq kleq 10^9 (there will always be a solution for the test cases). Input The input starts with an integer 1 le N le 20 on a line by itself. This is the number of test cases. A test case consists of four lines: first a single integer L which is the size of the message (at least 1, at most 200), second a line with L numbers (the message m), third a line with L numbers (the crypto text c) and finally a line with 100 numbers giving the substitution table p[] (the first number is p[1], the second is p[2] and so on). You can assume that the numbers in the message and crypto text are all integers that are at least 1 and at most 100. You can assume the same for p, and furthermore that p is one-to-one. Output For each test case output a single integer k on a line by itself. This k should be non-negative and at most 10^9, and obviously satisfy E^ k_ p(m)=c.
