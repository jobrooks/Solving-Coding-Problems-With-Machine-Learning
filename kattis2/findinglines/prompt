Annabel and Richard like to invent new games and play against each other. One day Annabel has a new game for Richard. In this game there is a game master and a player. The game master draws n points on a piece of paper. The task for the player is to find a straight line, such that at least p percent of the points lie exactly on that line. Richard and Annabel have very good tools for measurement and drawing. Therefore they can check whether a point lies exactly on a line or not. If the player can find such a line then the player wins. Otherwise the game master wins the game. There is just one problem. The game master can draw the points in a way such that it is not possible at all to draw a suitable line. They need an independent mechanism to check whether there even exists a line containing at least p percent of the points, i.e., leftlceil ncdot p/100 rightrceil  points. Now it is up to you to help them and write a program to solve this task. Input The input consists of: one line with one integer n (1le nle 10^5), the number of points the game master has drawn; one line with one integer p (20le p le 100), the percentage of points which need to lie on the line; n lines each with two integers x and y (0le x,yle 10^9), the coordinates of a point. No two points will coincide. Output Output one line containing either “possible” if it is possible to find a suitable line or “impossible” otherwise. (a) Sample input 1: A line with (at least) 3 of the points exists. (b) Sample input 2: No line with at least 3 points exists.
