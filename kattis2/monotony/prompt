You are given an r! times ! c grid. Each cell of this grid is filled with a number between 1 and r{cdot }c inclusive, and each cell’s number is distinct. Define a grid of numbers to be monotonic if each row and column is either increasing or decreasing (this can be different for each row or column). Define a subgrid of the grid as follows: First choose some nonempty subset of the rows and columns. Next, take elements that lie in both the chosen rows and columns in the same order. There are (2^ r{-}1)(2^ c{-}1) nonempty subgrids of the given grid. Of these subgrids, count how many are monotonic. Consider this grid: 1 2 5 7 6 4 9 8 3 There are nine 1{times }1 subgrids, nine 1{times }2’s, three 1{times }3’s, nine 2{times }1’s, nine 2{times }2’s, three 2{times }3’s, three 3{times }1’s, three 3{times }2’s, and one 3{times }3. They are all monotonic, for 9{+}9{+}3{+}9{+}9{+}3{+}3{+}3{+}1=49 monotonic subgrids. Input Each test case will begin with a line with two space-separated integers r and c (1! le ! r,c! le ! 20), which are the dimensions of the grid. Each of the next r lines will contain c space-separated integers x (1! le ! x! le ! r{cdot }c, all x’s are unique). This is the grid. Output Output a single integer, which is the number of monotonic subgrids in the given grid.
