In competitive weightlifting, you must perform a sequence of lifts. You have a constant strength s, and a decreasing energy reserve e. For each lift, you may choose any positive (not necessarily integer) weight w to attempt. If s ge w, the lift succeeds and your energy goes down by e_{text {success}}; if s < w, the lift fails and your energy goes down by e_{text {failure}}. You may continue attempting lifts as long as e > 0. If at any point e le 0, you can make no further attempts. Your score is the maximum weight you successfully lift or 0 if every attempt failed. Ideally, you should lift exactly at your strength limit. However, you do not know your strength s. You only know that you can definitely lift the empty bar (25text { kg}), and that the maximum conceivable lift is 225text { kg}. How close to an optimal score can you guarantee? That is, what’s the smallest d for which you can ensure a score of at least s-d? For example, suppose e = 4, e_{text {success}} = 1 and e_{text {failure}} = 2. You try to lift 200text { kg} and fail. Now, e = 2. You try 100text { kg} and succeed. Now, e = 1. You try 150text { kg} and succeed. Now, e = 0 and you must stop. You know that you can lift 150text { kg}, but you cannot lift 200text { kg}. Your strength s must be somewhere between 150text { kg} and 200text { kg}. You scored 150, your optimal score might be as high as (just under) 200. You still don’t know s, but you know you’re within 50. In this case, d = 50. That’s a specific example, and the strategy used is certainly not optimal. You can do better. What’s the smallest value of d you can get so that you can guarantee a score of at least s-d for any and all possible values of s? Input Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The input consists of a single line with 3 space-separated integers e, e_{text {success}}, e_{text {failure}} (1 le e, e_{text {success}}, e_{text {failure}} le 10^7) where e is your beginning energy reserve, e_{text {success}} is the amount of energy expended in a successful lift, and e_{text {failure}} is the amount of energy expended in a failed lift. Output Output a single line with a real number d, which is the minimum weight in text {kg} such that you can ensure a score of at least s-d. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-6}.
