You are given an undirected tree1 with each of its node assigned a magic X_ i. The magic of a path2 is defined as the product of the magic of the nodes on that path divided by the number of the nodes on the path. For example, the magic of a path that consists of nodes with magic 3 and 5 is 7.5 (3cdot 5 / 2). In the given tree, find the path with the minimal magic and output the magic of that path. Input The first line of input contains the integer N (1 leq N leq 10^6), the number of nodes in the tree. Each of the following N - 1 lines contains two integers, A_ i and B_ i (1 leq A_ i, B_ i leq N), the labels of nodes connected with an edge. The i-th of the following N lines contains the integer X_ i (1 leq X_ i leq 10^9), magic of the i-th node. Output Output the magic of the path with minimal magic in the form of a completely reduced fraction P/Q (P and Q are relatively prime integers). In all test cases, it will hold that the required P and Q are smaller than 10^{18}. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 1 2 3 4 3/1 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 5 1 2 2 4 1 3 5 2 2 1 1 1 3 1/2
