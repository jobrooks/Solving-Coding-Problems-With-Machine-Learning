The player starts with a prize of 1, and is asked a sequence of n questions. For each question, he may quit and keep his prize. answer the question. If wrong, he quits with nothing. If correct, the prize is doubled, and he continues with the next question. After the last question, he quits with his prize. The player wants to maximize his expected prize. Once each question is asked, the player is able to assess the probability p that he will be able to answer it. For each question independently, we assume that p is a random variable uniformly distributed over the range t \ldots 1. Input Input is a number of lines, each with two numbers: an integer 1 \le n \le 30, and a real 0 \le t \le 1. Input is terminated by a line containing 0 0. This line should not be processed. There are at most 300 test cases. Output For each input n and t$, print the playerâ€™s expected prize, if he plays the best strategy. Output should be rounded to three fractional digits. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 0.3 2 0.6 24 0.25 0 0 1.357 2.560 230.138
