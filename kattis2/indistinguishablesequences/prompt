SoCCat the Group Theorist is a very detail-oriented cat. Currently, SoCCat is researching a unique equivalence relation on sequences! SoCCat defines a map L: bigcup _{iin mathbb N} mathbb Z^ i to mathbb N which takes in a sequence mathbf s = (s_1, s_2, ldots , s_ k) of integers and outputs the length of a longest (strictly) increasing subsequence of mathbf s. Two sequences mathbf s = (s_1, s_2, ldots , s_ k) and mathbf t = (t_1, t_2, ldots , t_ l) are said to be indistinguishable if and only if they belong to the same fiber of the map L – in other words, if L(s_1, s_2, ldots , s_ k) = L(t_1, t_2, ldots , t_ l). That is, two sequences are indistinguishable if and only if the lengths of their longest increasing subsequences are the same. SoCCat considers a very natural question: given a sequence mathbf a = (a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ n), how many subsequences of mathbf a are indistinguishable from the original sequence mathbf a itself? SoCCat doesn’t believe that you can do it, so they simply gave you a random permutation mathbf a for you to tinker with. Surprise SoCCat by outputting the answer modulo 1, 000, 003, 233! Input The first line of input contains an integer n, the length of the sequence (1 leq n leq 100, 000). The second line of input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ n, the integers in the permutation (1 leq a_ i leq n; a_ i neq a_ j if i neq j). The permutation mathbf a is uniformly randomly generated from all n! possible permutations. Output Output a single integer, the number of subsequences of mathbf a that are indistinguishable from mathbf a. In other words, output the number of subsequences of mathbf a such that the length of their longest increasing subsequence is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence of mathbf a. As the answer can be very large, output the answer modulo 1, 000, 003, 233. Notes A sequence mathbf b is called a subsequence of another sequence mathbf a = (a_1,ldots , a_ n) if there is a strictly increasing sequence of indices i_1,ldots , i_ p such that mathbf b = (a_{i_1},ldots , a_{i_ p}). In the sample test case, we have L(mathbf a) = 2, and any subsequences of mathbf a that belongs to the same fiber of L as mathbf a must contain a_2 = 1, as well as either of a_3 or a_4 (or both).
