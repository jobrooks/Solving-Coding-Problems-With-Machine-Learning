Given an grid with N rows and M columns, your task is to find a tour such that: The tour has length at least two All squares in the grid are visited exactly once Let a_1, dots , a_{NM} be the sequence of visited squares. Then d(a_ k, a_{k+1}) = 2 or 3 for every 1 leq k < NM. Also, d(a_{NM}, a_1) = 2 or 3. Here, d(p, q) denotes the Manhattan distance between p and q. More precisely, if p is the square on row r_ p and column c_ p and q is the square on row r_ q and column c_ q, then we write p = (r_ p, c_ p), q = (r_ q, c_ q) and d(p, q) = |r_ p - r_ q| + |c_ p - c_ q|. Input The first and only line of input consists of two integers N and M (1 leq N, M leq 200). Output If there is no such tour, output -1. Otherwise, output N times M lines. The ith line contains two space-separated integers, denoting the row and column numbers of a_ i. If there is more than one such tour, any one will be accepted.
