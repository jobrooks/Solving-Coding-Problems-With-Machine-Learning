I bet you have seen a pebble solitaire game. You know the game where you are given a board with an arrangment of small cavities, initially all but one occupied by a pebble each. The aim of the game is to remove as many pebbles as possible from the board. Pebbles disappear from the board as a result of a move. A move is possible if there is a straight line of three adjacent cavities, let us call them A, B, and C, with B in the middle, where A is vacant, but B and C each contain a pebble. The move consists of moving the pebble from C to A, and removing the pebble in B from the board. You may continue to make moves until no more moves are possible. In this problem, we look at a simple variant of this game, namely a board with 23 cavities located along a line. In the beginning of each game, some of the cavities are occupied by pebbles. Your mission is to find a sequence of moves such that as few pebbles as possible are left on the board. Figure 1: In a) there are two possible moves, namely 8 rightarrow 6, or 7 rightarrow 9. In b) the result of the 8 rightarrow 6 move is depicted, and again there are two possible moves, 5 rightarrow 7, or 6 rightarrow 4. Making the first of these results in c), from which there are no further moves. Input The input begins with a positive integer n le 10 on a line of its own. Thereafter n different games follow. Each game consists of one line of input with exactly 23 characters, describing the 23 cavities of the board in order. Each character is either ‘-’ or ‘o’. A ‘-’ character denotes an empty cavity, whereas an ‘o’ character denotes a cavity with a pebble in it. There is at least one pebble in all games. Output For each of the n games in the input, output the minimum number of pebbles left on the board possible to obtain as a result of moves, on a line of its own.
