You are developing software for a new generation of robotic floor vacuums. Being an inexpensive, mass market robot, this device has a fairly simple way of navigating around the room. It can turn by some angle to the left or right and then move forward in a straight line. A plan for the robot consists of a sequence of these straight-line segments. The robot starts at the origin, facing in the positive Y direction. Your job is to try to predict where the robot will be after following a plan. Input Input consists of several test cases. The first line contains an integer 1 leq n leq 25 telling how many. Each of the following test cases begins with an integer, 1 leq m leq 10, giving the number of segments in the robotâ€™s plan. This is followed by m lines, each describing a segment in the plan. Each segment is described by a pair of real numbers, a rotation angle in degrees followed by a distance. The angle is in the range [-360,360] and the distance is in the range [-100,100]. The rotation angle tells how much the robot should turn before moving forward the given distance. A positive rotation angle indicates a counter-clockwise turn. A negative angle indicates a clockwise turn. All real numbers have at most 8 digits past the decimal. Output For each test case, print out the expected X ; Y location of the robot after following the path. Your answer should be accurate to within 10^{-3} for each coordinate.
