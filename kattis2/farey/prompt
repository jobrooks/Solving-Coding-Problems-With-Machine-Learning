Given a positive integer, N, the sequence of all fractions a / b with 0 le a le b, 1 le b le N and a and b relatively prime, listed in increasing order, is called the Farey Sequence of order N. For example, the Farey Sequence of order 6 is:\[ 0/1, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 1/1 \] For this problem, you will write a program to compute the length of the Farey Sequence of order N. Input The first line of input contains a single integer P (1 le P le 10, 000), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed identically and independently. Each data set consists of a single line of input. It contains the data set number, K, followed by the order N (2 le N le 10, 000) of the Farey Sequence whose length is to be found. Output For each data set there is a single line of output. The single output line consists of the data set number, K, followed by a single space followed by the length of the Farey Sequence as a decimal integer.
