Input The first line of input contains a line with four non-negative integers, 2 le n le 500, 0 le m le 10, 000, 0 le s le n-1 and 0 le t le n-1, separated by single spaces, where n is the numbers of nodes in the graph, m is the number of edges, s is the source and t is the sink (s ne t). Nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1. Then follow m lines, each line consisting of three (space-separated) integers u, v and c indicating that there is an edge from u to v in the graph with capacity 1 le c le 10^{8}. Output The output should begin with a line containing three integers n, f, and m’. n is the number of nodes in the flow graph (same as in input), f is the size of a maximum flow from node s to node t in the flow graph, and m’ is the number of edges used in the solution. You may assume that f < 2^{31}. Then there should be m’ lines, each containing three integers u, v and x, indicating that x units of flow are transported from u to v. x must be greater than 0 and at most as big as the capacity from u to v. Each pair of vertices (u, v) should be given at most once in the output.
