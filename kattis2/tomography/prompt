Binary tomography deals with the problem of reconstructing binary images from a small number of projections. One of its most basic problems is to construct a binary ({ 0,1} -valued) matrix with given row and column sums. This is not always possible and your task is to determine when it is. Input The first line of input contains two numbers 1leq m,nleq 1000, the number of rows and columns of the matrix. The next line contains m numbers 0leq r_ ileq n – the sum of each row in the matrix. The third line contains n numbers 0leq c_ jleq m – the sum of each column in the matrix. Output Output “Yes” if there exists an m-by-n matrix mathbf{A}, with each element either beeing 0 or 1, such that\[ \sum _{j=1}^ nA_{i,j} = r_ i \; \forall i\in \{ 1,2,... ,m\} \textrm{ and } \sum _{i=1}^ mA_{i,j} = c_ j \; \forall j\in \{ 1,2,... ,n\} . \] Otherwise output “No”. Example The figure below illustrates a matrix with the row and column sums of sample input 1. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 4 2 3 2 1 1 3 2 Yes Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 3 No
