Given N points on a 2-dimensional space, determine the area of the largest triangle that can be formed using 3 of those N points. If there is no triangle that can be formed, the answer is 0. Input The first line contains an integer N (3 le N le 5, 000) denoting the number of points. Each of the next N lines contains two integers x and y (0 leq x, y leq 4 cdot 10^7). There are no specific constraints on these N points, i.e. the points are not necessarily distinct, the points are not given in specific order, there may be 3 or more collinear points, etc. Output Print the answer in one line. Your answer should have an absolute error of at most 10^{-5}. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 7 0 0 0 5 7 7 0 10 0 0 20 0 10 10 100.00000
