You are given four points in space (i.e. mathbb {R}^3). The points are not coplanar. In other words, there is no plane in space that contains all four points. It is guaranteed that under such assumption, there exists a (unique) sphere whose surface touches all four points. Find the coordinates of the centre of the sphere. Input The input consists of four lines. Line i consists of three integers x_ i, y_ i, z_ i, representing the coordinates (x_ i, y_ i, z_ i) of point i. For all test cases, -100 leq x_ i, y_ i, z_ i leq 100. Output Output three numbers (not necessarily integers) x_ c, y_ c, z_ c, representing the coordinates (x_ c, y_ c, z_ c) of the centre of the sphere that touches all four points. Let the juryâ€™s answer be (x_ j, y_ j, z_ j). Your answer will be considered as correct if and only if\[ \sqrt {(x_ j - x_ c)^2 + (y_ j - y_ c)^2 + (z_ j - z_ c)^2} < 10^{-4}. \] Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 -1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0.0 0.0 -0.0 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 6 0 1 -2 -3 3.5 3.0 -3.16666667
