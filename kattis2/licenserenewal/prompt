Photo from sabreguy29 Rookie Bunny is helping the motor vehicle department to renew licenses for its customers. She works at the ticket machine and gives tickets to customers to tell them at which counters they will be served. There are two counters providing service in the office today. The two counters will be open for at most s_1 and s_2 minutes respectively. There are n customers waiting in a line in front of the ticket machine. Every customer can be served at either counter. The jth customer needs t_ j minutes at a counter. If neither counter has t_ j minutes till its closing time, then the customer has to leave and come back tomorrow. Besides, all customers in the line behind the jth customer have to leave to respect the order of the line and avoid customer complaints. Rookie Bunny may assign each customer in the line to either counter of her choice. She would like to maximize the number of customers that can be served today. Input The first line has three positive integers n, s_1, and s_2 (n leq 1, 000, s_1 cdot s_2 leq 10^{7}). The second line has n integers. The jth integer is t_ j (1 leq t_ j leq 10^6). Output Output the maximum number of customers that can be served today. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 20 20 7 11 9 12 2 4 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 5 100 100 101 1 1 1 1 0
