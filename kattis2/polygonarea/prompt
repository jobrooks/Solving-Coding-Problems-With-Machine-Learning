Sample test cases. Compute the area of a simple polygon, and the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) in which its vertices are given. Input Input contains up to 25 test cases. Each test case begins with an integer n (3 leq n leq 1, 000). Then follow the n vertices of a simple polygon, one per line, each of the form x y. The points may be given in either clockwise or counterclockwise order. Coordinates are integers with absolute value bounded by 10, 000. The input is terminated by a case beginning with 0. Output For each test case, output a line D A, where D is one of “CW” or “CCW”, indicating whether the polygon was given in clockwise or counterclockwise order, respectively. A is the area of the polygon, given with exactly one digit after the decimal point. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 0 0 10 0 0 10 5 41 -6 -24 -74 -51 -6 73 17 -30 -34 0 CCW 50.0 CW 3817.5
