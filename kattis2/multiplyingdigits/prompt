Picture by Mees de Vries For every positive integer we may obtain a non-negative integer by multiplying its digits. This defines a function f, e.g. f(38) = 24. This function gets more interesting if we allow for other bases. In base 3, the number 80 is written as 2222, so: f_3(80) = 16. We want you to solve the reverse problem: given a base B and a number N, what is the smallest positive integer X such that f_ B(X) = N? Input The input consists of a single line containing two integers B and N, satisfying 2 < B leq 10, 000 and 0 < N < 2^{63}. Output Output the smallest positive integer solution X of the equation f_ B(X) = N. If no such X exists, output the word “impossible”. The input is carefully chosen such that X < 2^{63} holds (if X exists).
