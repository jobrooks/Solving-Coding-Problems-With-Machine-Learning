Given an integer N, compute the sum\[ \sum _{i \mid N} \sum _{j \mid N} \gcd (i, j) \text {.} \] Here, gcd (i, j) is the greatest common divisor of i and j, and i mid N denotes that i is a divisor of N. Input The first and only line contains the integer N (1 le N le 10^{14}). Output Output the sum in the task description. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 6 30 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 7 10
