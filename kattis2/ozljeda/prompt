Due to the frantical usage of the racket to kill flies, Marin has sustained a serious bodily injury known to the medical community as epicondylitis lateralis humeri. His grandma has advised smearing rakija over it, the doctor has prescribed a strong painkiller, but Marin has ignored every single advice and decided to look for the answer in integer sequences. He has discovered a previously undiscovered sequence of integers and called it the xorbonacci sequence. The n-th element in the sequence is denoted with x_ n. The sequence is defined recursively in the following way:Equations:  x_1 & = a_1,,  x_2 & = a_2,,  & ldots ,  x_ k & = a_ k,,  x_ n & = x_{n-1} oplus x_{n-2} oplus ldots oplus x_{n-k}, quad n > k,   Because of a reason only known to Marin, he determined that all his sorrows will go away if you answer his Q queries defined with numbers l and r. The answer to the query is represented with the value\begin{equation*} x_ l \oplus x_{l+1} \oplus \ldots \oplus x_{r-1} \oplus x_ r \end{equation*} Help Marin and answer his queries. Please note: The operation oplus  is the operation of binary XOR. Input The first line of input contains the integer K (1 leq K leq 100, 000) from the task. The following line contains K integers that represent the first K elements in the xorbonacci sequence. All numbers are smaller than 10^{18}. The following line contains the integer Q (1 leq Q leq 10^6) from the task. The i-th of the following Q lines contains two integers l_ i and r_ i (1 leq l_ i leq r_ i leq 10^{18}) that represent Marin’s i-th query. Output Each of the following Q lines of output must contain the answers to Marin’s queries, the order being the same as the input.
