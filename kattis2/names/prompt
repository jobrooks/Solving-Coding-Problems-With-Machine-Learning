Image by Eviatar Bach. Anna and Bob are having a baby. They both enjoy the advantage of having palindrome names, meaning that their names are spelled the same way forwards and backwards. Wanting to be good parents, they decide to give their child a palindrome name too. The only problem is that they aren’t sure if the one they picked is a palindrome.
