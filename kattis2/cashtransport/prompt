CSN just sent you this month’s student loan. Finally, you have enough money to rent DBus, the computer science student division’s very own van! You’ve thought about going on a road trip but as the responsible student you are you’ve decided to use this possibility to earn money. And is there a better strat in the capitalist grind than robbing armored cash transports? There are N banks. Bank i has a balance of a_ i on day 0. During the following M days there will be a cash transport every day. A cash transport goes from bank a to bank b and takes all of the money in bank a and gives it to bank b. During your time with DBus you will have time to rob K cash transports (not necessarily consecutively). How much money can you rob at most? Input The first line of input contains three integers N, M and K (1 le N le 3 cdot 10^5, 1 le M le 3 cdot 10^5 and 1 le K le M). The second line contains N space-separated integers a_0, a_1, ldots , a_ N (0 le a_ i le 10^9), denoting the initial balance of bank i. The following M lines contains integers a and b (0 le a, b < N, a neq b). Each pair describes a cash transport between banks a and b. Output Output a single integer: the maximum amount you can steal from the cash transports. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 3 1 9 3 1 1 0 1 0 2 1 3 12
