Rita loves her Birthday parties. She is really happy when blowing the candles at the Happy Birthday’s clap melody. Every year since the age of four she adds her birthday candles (one for every year of age) to a candle box. Her younger daydreaming brother Theo started doing the same at the age of three. Rita’s and Theo’s boxes look the same, and so do the candles. One day Rita decided to count how many candles she had in her box: – No, no, no! I’m younger than that! She just realized Theo had thrown some of his birthday candles in her box all these years. Can you help Rita fix the number of candles in her candle box?
