You have a radio receiver and want to receive N messages. Each message is transmitted at a predetermined time measured in seconds since the epoch. Also each message is transmitted from a predetermined position representing the displacement in meters from the origin (you are in 1-dimensional space). Your radio is capable of receiving any message that is transmitted no farther than D meters from your current position, where D is a nonnegative real number. You can start at any position of your choice and move at the rate of at most one meter per second. The action of receiving a message itself takes no time. Your task is to find the smallest D that allows you to get all messages. Input The first line of input gives the number of test cases, C. C test cases follow. For each test case there will be: One line containing the integer N, the number of messages. N lines corresponding to the N messages where each of them contains 2 integers P and T separated by one space. P is the position where the message is transmitted from and T is the time when this message is transmitted (The messages will have distinct transmission times). You may assume that 1 leq N leq 1, 000 and 0 leq P, T leq 10^{9}. Output For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: ", where x is the number of the test case, followed by the minimum value D that allows you to get all messages. Answers with a relative or absolute error of at most 10^{-9} will be considered correct.
