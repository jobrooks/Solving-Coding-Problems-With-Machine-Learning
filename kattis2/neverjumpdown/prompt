You are given a rooted tree of N vertices where each vertex v_1 through v_ N is labeled with a non-negative integer u_1 through u_ N. The vertex v_1 is the root. Define a “jumping path” within the tree to be a sequence a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ k of length k where v_{a_ i} is an ancestor of v_{a_ j} for all 1 le i < j le k. Compute two quantities for the given tree: The length L of the longest jumping path where the labels of the vertices are nondecreasing. That is, u_{a_ i} le u_{a_ j} for all 1 le i < j le L. The number M of jumping paths of length L where the labels of the vertices are nondecreasing. Since this number may be large, give the remainder of M when divided by the prime 11, 092, 019. Input The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the number of vertices in the tree (1 leq N leq 10^6). This is followed by N lines of input indicating the labels u_1 through u_ N. Each label is an integer in the range [0, 10^6]. The remaining N-1 lines describe the tree structure. Skipping the root (which has no parent) and starting with i=2, line i gives the parent p_ i < i of vertex v_ i. Output Print a single line of output with two integers separated by a space. The first integer is L, and the second integer is M modulo the prime 11, 092, 019.
