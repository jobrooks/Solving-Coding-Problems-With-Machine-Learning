Unfortunately, you realize that it was way too long since you played chess. Even trivial puzzles such as finding a mate in one now far exceed your ability. But, perseverance is the key to success.

You will be given a chess board, which satisfy: No player may castle. No player can perform an en passant1 The board is a valid chess position. White can mate black in a single, unique move.
