On an infinitely large grid, a generalized knight stands at position (0, 0). The knight is allowed to move in 8 ways. First, it may move either pm a or pm b steps horizontally, and then pm a or pm b steps vertically. Compute the minimum number of moves the knight must make to reach the position (x, y). Input The first and only line contains the four integers a, b, x, y from the statement (1 le a neq b le 10^{9}, 0 le x, y le 10^9). It is guaranteed that the knight can reach (x, y), and (x, y) is not (0, 0). Output Output a single integer â€“ the minimum number of moves from position (0, 0) to (x, y).
