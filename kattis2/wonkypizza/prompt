Illustration of Sample Input 1. The first cut at theta =0 is along the solid blue line, and the second cut at theta approx 3.74633 is along the dashed blue line. Together, the cuts split the pizza into two pieces of equal area. As is customary at the ACPC, there will be pizza.1 However, due to logistical challenges, the only pizza available is a wonky pizza. The organizers will buy one wonky pizza and need to cut it into N pieces, one for each of the N contestants. The organizers will have to fight over who gets to eat the napkins. A wonky pizza is like a regular pizza, except that at an angle of theta  radians (measured counter-clockwise) from the positive x axis, the shape extends frac{alpha theta }{2pi }+beta  units from the origin, for some alpha  and beta  (in contrast, a normal pizza extends r units from the origin at every angle theta , where r is the radius of the pizza). Each cut will follow a straight line from the origin to the outer boundary, so cutting straight across the entire pizza would require two cuts. The first cut will be made at an angle of 0 radians. Determine what angles to make the remaining N-1 cuts at to split the pizza into N pieces of equal area. Input The input consists of a single line with three numbers, alpha , beta , and N, where 0le alpha ,beta le 10, and N is an integer with 2le Nle 100. It is guaranteed that alpha  and beta  are not both zero. Output The output should consist of N-1 lines, where the i^{th} line contains the angle of cut i in radians. The angles should be specified in order from smallest to largest. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesnâ€™t exceed 10^{-4}.
