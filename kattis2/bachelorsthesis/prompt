SoCCat the Undergraduate is a very studious cat. Currently, SoCCat is writing their Bachelor’s Thesis! For SoCCat’s Final Year Project, SoCCat will write a thesis studying the behaviour of a particular operation: the cat-split. Initially, suppose SoCCat has an array of n integers a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ n, and an integer k (1 leq k leq n). In one cat-split operation, SoCCat will do all of the following in order: Choose any subsequence of a which consists of exactly k elements. Delete the chosen subsequence from the array a. Append the values of the chosen subsequence to the beginning of the array a in reverse order. For example, for an array a = [5, 1, 4, 2, 3] and integer k = 3, SoCCat can choose the subsequence [1, 4, 3]. Next, SoCCat will remove the elements [1,4,3] from a, after which the array will become [5,2]. Finally, SoCCat will prepend the elements [1, 4, 3] in reverse order, after which the array will become [3,4,1,5,2]. SoCCat is interested in knowing the minimum possible number of inversions in the array a after doing the cat-split operation between 0 up to 100, 000 times. As SoCCat is busy studying other properties of the cat-split operation, they turn to you for help! Note that you do not have to minimize the number of cat-split operations, only the number of inversions in the resulting array. As a reminder, b_1, b_2, ldots , b_ k is a subsequence of a if and only if b_1, b_2, ldots , b_ k can be obtained from a by deleting zero or more elements from it without changing the order of the remaining elements. The inversion of an array a is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and a_ i > a_ j. Input The first line of input contains two integers n and k, denoting the number of elements in the array a and the specific number of elements chosen in the subsequence for each cat-split operation (1 leq n leq 100; 1 leq k leq n). The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ n, denoting the elements of the array a (1 leq a_ i leq 100). Output In the first line, output the minimum possible number of inversions in the resulting array after doing the cat-split operation between 0 up to 100, 000 times. In the second line, output l, denoting the number of cat-split operations SoCCat should perform to obtain the minimum number of inversions in the resulting array (0 leq l leq 100, 000). You do not have to minimize l. Each of the following l lines should contain a binary string of length n, denoting the subsequence SoCCat should choose for that particular operation. The i-th character of the binary string should be 1 if the i-th element of the array is chosen for the subsequence, and 0 otherwise. Note that each binary string should therefore contain exactly k 1’s.
