It’s time for the Trivia Trot, a competition where anything—and everything—can be asked! Twilight is absolutely ready to wreck the competition and win it for the three-peat; she’s studied Ancient Legends, Wonderbolt History, and Spells So Old, Not Even Star Swirl the Bearded Remembers Them... Figure 1: Illustration by Kyle Coate. Here’s the first question: How many sequences x_1, x_2, dots , x_ P of P positive integers are there satisfying gcd (x_1, x_2, dots , x_ P) = G_1 times G_2 times dots times G_ N and mathrm{lcm}(x_1, x_2, dots , x_ P) = L_1 times L_2 times dots times L_ M? Crap. Input The first line of input contains three integers, P (1 leq P leq 10^{18}), N and M (1 leq N, M leq 400), as described in the question. The second line of input contains N integers G_1, G_2, dots , G_ N (1 leq G_ i leq 10^{18}), as described in the question. The third line of input contains M integers L_1, L_2, dots , L_ M (1 leq L_ i leq 10^{18}), as described in the question. Output Output the a single integer on a line by itself, the answer to the question. Since this number can be quite large, you should output only the remainder after dividing this number by 10^9+7. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 1 2 3 17 18 216 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 77 10 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 0
