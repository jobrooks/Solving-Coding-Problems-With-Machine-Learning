You are the proud owner of a beautiful convex polygon! But university is expensive, so you decide to sell your polygon to support your studies. The market value, in dollars, for a polygon is exactly twice its area. But there is an illegal black market for individual vertices. In this problem, you are given a convex polygon with vertices P. Each vertex p_ i in P has a value v_ i. You can form a new polygon using a subset of points Q subseteq P. You can then legally sell the polygon formed by vertices Q and also sell the points P-Q on the black market. The amount of money you would earn this way is 2 cdot {rm area}(Q) + sum _{p_ i in P-Q} v_ i where {rm area}(Q) is the area of the unique convex polygon having vertices Q. Figure 1: Left: Illustration of first sample input. Right: Solution for the first sample. Discard just the point at (6, 6). You are guaranteed no three vertices of P are collinear, and you also have {rm area}(Q) = 0 for each set Q with at most two points. Note that it is valid for the polygon from Q to be degenerate (i.e. have an area of 0). Input The first line of input consists of a single integer 3 leq n leq 200 indicating the number of points on your convex polygon. Then n lines follow. The i’th such line contains three integers x_ i, y_ i, v_ i describing the coordinates (x_ i, y_ i) and value v_ i of the i’ vertex on the polygon. You are guaranteed |x_ i|, |y_ i| leq 10^6 and 0leq v_ ileq 10^9. The points are given in counterclockwise order around P. You are guaranteed no three points are collinear, and the polygon P is convex. Output A single line with a single integer indicating the maximum amount of money that can be obtained by selling a subset of P on the black market and legally selling the polygon defined by the remaining points.
