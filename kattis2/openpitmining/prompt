Open-pit mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rocks are found near the surface. Automatic Computer Mining (ACM) is a company that would like to maximize its profits by open-pit mining. ACM has hired you to write a program that will determine the maximum profit it can achieve given the description of a piece of land. Each piece of land is modelled as a set of blocks of material. Block i has an associated value (v_ i), as well as a cost (c_ i), to dig that block from the land. Some blocks obstruct or bury other blocks. So for example if block i is obstructed by blocks j and k, then one must first dig up blocks j and k before block i can be dug up. A block can be dug up when it has no other blocks obstructing it. Input The first line of input is an integer N (1 leq N leq 200) which is the number of blocks. These blocks are numbered 1 through N. Then follow N lines describing these blocks. The ith such line describes block i and starts with two integers v_ i, c_ i denoting the value and cost of the ith block (0 leq v_ i, c_ i leq 200). Then a third integer 0 leq m_ i leq N-1 on this line describes the number of blocks that block i obstructs. Following that are m_ i distinct space separated integers between 1 and N (but excluding i) denoting the label(s) of the blocks that block i obstructs. You may assume that it is possible to dig up every block for some digging order. The sum of values m_ i over all blocks i will be at most 500. Output Output a single integer giving the maximum profit that ACM can achieve from the given piece of land. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 0 3 2 2 3 1 3 2 4 5 4 8 1 4 5 3 0 9 2 0 2
