Define a k-periodic string as follows: A string s is k-periodic if the length of the string |s| is a multiple of k, and if you chop the string up into |s|/k substrings of length k, then each of those substrings (except the first) is the same as the previous substring, but with its last character moved to the front. For example, the following string is 3-periodic: abccabbcaabc The above string can break up into substrings abc, cab, bca, and abc, and each substring (except the first) is a right-rotation of the previous substring (abc -> cab -> bca -> abc) Given a string, determine the smallest k for which the string is k-periodic. Input Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The single line of input contains a string s (1 le |s| le 100) consisting only of lowercase letters. Output Output the integer k, which is the smallest k for which the input string is k-periodic.
