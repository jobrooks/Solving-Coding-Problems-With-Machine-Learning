The Brocard point of a triangle ABC is a point P in the triangle chosen so that: angle PAB = angle PBC = angle PCA (see figure below). The common angle is called the Brocard angle. The largest Brocard angle is pi /6 which is the Brocard angle for an equilateral triangle (the Brocard point is the centroid of the triangle). Write a program to compute the coordinates of the Brocard point of a triangle given the coordinates of the vertices. Input The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 le P le 600), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed identically and independently. Each data set consists of a single line of input. It contains the data set number, K, followed by the six space separated coordinate values A_ x, A_ y, B_ x, B_ y, C_ x, C_ y of the vertices of the triangle, which are in the range (-20 le A_ x, A_ y, B_ x, B_ y, C_ x, C_ y le 20). The vertices will always be specified so going from A to B to C and back to A circles the triangle counter-clockwise. Input coordinates are floating point values with up to 4 digits after the period. Output For each data set there is a single line of output. The single output line consists of the data set number, K, followed by a single space followed by the x coordinate of the Brocard point, followed by a single space followed by the y coordinate of the Brocard point. The coordinates are considered correct if their individual absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-5}.
