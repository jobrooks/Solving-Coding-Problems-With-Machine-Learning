In graph theory, a tree is a connected, undirected simple graph with no cycles. A tree with n nodes always has n - 1 edges. A path in a tree is a sequence of distinct edges which are connected (each pair of consecutive edges in the path share a vertex). Consider a tree with n vertices and n-1 edges. You can color each edge in one of k colors. An assignment of colors to edges is a rainbow coloring if in every path of 2 or 3 edges, the colors of the edges are different. (i.e., every two consecutive edges have different colors, and every three consecutive edges have different colors). Given a tree and the number of colors k, find the number of rainbow colorings modulo 1, 000, 000, 009. Input The first line of input gives the number of test cases, C. Then for each of the C cases, there will be: One line containing two integers n and k, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and k is the number of colors available. n - 1 lines, one for each edge, containing two integers x, y, indicating that the edge is between node x and node y. Nodes are numbered from 1 to n. You may assume that 1 leq k leq 1, 000, 000, 000 and all the node numbers are between 1 and n, inclusive. Furthermore, 2 leq n leq 500. Output For each test case, output one line. That line should contain "Case #X: Y", where X is 1-based number of the case, and Y is the answer for that test case.
