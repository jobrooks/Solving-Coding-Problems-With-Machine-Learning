A set of 8 intervals corresponding to sample input 2. The maximum number of nonoverlapping intervals is 3, achieved by the highlighted intervals. Consider a set of n intervals I_1,ldots , I_ n, each given as an integer tuple (s_ i, f_ i) with s_ i<f_ i, such that the ith interval starts at s_ i and ends at f_ i. We want to determine the maximum number of nonoverlapping intervals. More formally, we want to determine the size of a largest subset Ssubseteq { 1,ldots ,n}  such that for i, jin S with ineq j we have f_ j leq s_ i or f_ ileq s_ j. Note that the intervals [1,2] and [2,3] are not considered to be overlapping. Input The first line of input consists of an integer nin { 1,ldots , 10^5} , the number of intervals. Each of the following n lines consists of two space-separated integers s and f, indicating an interval starting at s and ending at f, with 0leq s<fleq 10^9. Output Output a single integer, the largest number of nonoverlapping intervals. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 1 4 2 8 5 9 2 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 8 0 6 1 4 3 5 3 8 4 7 5 9 6 10 8 11 3
