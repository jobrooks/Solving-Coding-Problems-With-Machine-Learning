Fizz Buzz implemented in Hexagony. CC BY-SA 3.0 by M L on codegolf.stackexchange.com Fizz Buzz is a party game that is often used as a programming exercise in job interviews. In the game, there are two positive integers a and b, and the game consists of counting up through the positive integers, replacing any number by Fizz if it is a multiple of a, by Buzz if it is a multiple of b, and by FizzBuzz if it is a multiple of both a and b. The most common form of the game has a=3 and b=5, but other parameters are allowed. Your task here is to solve the reverse problem: given a transcript of part of the game (not necessarily starting at 1), find possible values of a and b that could have been used to generate it. Figure 1 shows some sample sequences for various values of a and b. a=3, b=5: 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz a=6, b=2: 1 Buzz 3 Buzz 5 FizzBuzz 7 Buzz 9 Buzz 11 FizzBuzz 13 a=4, b=4: 1 2 3 FizzBuzz 5 6 7 FizzBuzz 9 10 11 FizzBuzz 13 14 Figure 1: Example sequences for Fizz Buzz. Input The input consists of: One line with two integers c and d (1 le c le d le 10^5), indicating that your transcript starts at c and ends at d. One line with d-c+1 integers and strings, the contents of the transcript. It is guaranteed that the transcript is valid for some integers a and b with 1 le a,b le 10^6, according to the rules laid out above. Output Output two positive integers a and b (1 le a,b le 10^6) that are consistent with the given transcript. If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output any one of them.
