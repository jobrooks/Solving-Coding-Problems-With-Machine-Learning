Image editing software like Photoshop provide many image effects like blur, sharpen, and edge detection. These effects are commonly implemented through a kernel, a matrix describing a certain image effect. The kernel is applied to an image through convolution: flipping both the rows and columns of the kernel and then multiplying locationally similar entries and summing. For example, letâ€™s say we have the 4 times 4 image  begin{bmatrix} a & b & c & d  e & f & g & h  i & j & k & l  m & n & o & p end{bmatrix}  and the 2 times 2 kernel  begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2  3 & 4 end{bmatrix}.  After convolution, the resulting 3 times 3 image would be:\[ \begin{bmatrix} 4a+3b+2e+1f & 4b+3c+2f+1g & 4c+3d+2g+1h \\ 4e+3f+2i+1j & 4f+3g+2j+1k & 4g+3h+2k+1l \\ 4i+3j+2m+1n & 4j+3k+2n+1o & 4k+3l+2o+1p \end{bmatrix} \] A real-world example of this is the blur effect: \[ \Rightarrow \frac{1}{9} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \] Photo by Michael Plotke cc by-sa 3.0 Input The first line of the input contains four integers, H, the height of the image, W, the width of the image, N, the height of the kernel, and M, the width of the kernel (1 leq H leq 20, 1 leq W leq 20, 1 leq N leq H, 1 leq M leq W). Each of the next H lines contains W integers, between 0 and 100 inclusive, representing the image. Each of the next N lines contains M integers, between 0 and 100 inclusive, representing the kernel. Output Output the resulting image after convolution, consisting of H-N+1 lines, each with W-M+1 integers.
