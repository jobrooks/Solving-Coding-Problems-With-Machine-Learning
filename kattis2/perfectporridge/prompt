As a true student Lucky Luke eats a big bowl of perfect porridge each morning. Lukeâ€™s goal in life is to get every chalmerist to love porridge. In the faculty there are N yet-to-be-enlightened students. Luke is unfortunately not necessarily able to serve perfect porridge to all of them. But he will do his best and try to serve as many of them as possible. He starts to microwave the water and oat mixture at t=0, one portion at a time with each requiring 2 minutes of microwaving in the sole available microwave oven on campus. A man of great manners, Luke will serve the chosen subset of students all at once. There are two complications: first, porridge will go cold after staying out in the open for M minutes, requiring 1 minute of re-heating. Second, the entitled brats care more about their exams than porridge and will leave the table when they grow impatient. Student i has an associated impatience I_ i, the time after which they will leave the table. Porridge that is done at time t will be cold at time t+M but not at time t+M-1. Luke can schedule cooking and re-heating however he wants. For example, he is allowed to do the following: cooking, cooking, re-heating, cooking, re-heating, all in the span of 8 minutes. A student with impatience I_ i will still be at the table at time I_ i, but not at time I_ i+1. Luke must not necessarily serve all seated students at the time of serving. Input The first line of input contains two integers N, 1 leq N leq 500, 000, the number of students and M, 1 leq M leq 10^9, the number of minutes it takes for warm porridge to get cold. The second line contains the N integers I_0, I_1 ldots I_{N-1}, where I_ i, 1 leq I_ i leq 10^9, denotes the impatience of student i. Output Output a single integer, the maximal number of students that Lucky Luke can convince to love porridge.
