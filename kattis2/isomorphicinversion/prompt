Let s be a given string of up to 10^6 digits. Find the maximal k for which it is possible to partition s into k consecutive contiguous substrings, such that the k parts form a palindrome. More precisely, we say that strings s_0, s_1, dots , s_{k-1} form a palindrome if s_ i = s_{k-1-i} for all 0leq i < k. In the first sample case, we can split the string 652526 into 4 parts as 6|52|52|6, and these parts together form a palindrome. It turns out that it is impossible to split this input into more than 4 parts while still making sure the parts form a palindrome. Input A nonempty string of up to 10^6 digits. Output Print the maximal value of k on a single line.
