The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely represented as a product of one or more primes. While unique, several arrangements of the prime factors may be possible. For example:Equations:  10 & = 2 cdot 5 & 20 & = 2 cdot 2 cdot 5 ,  & = 5 cdot 2 & & = 2 cdot 5 cdot 2 ,  & & & = 5 cdot 2 cdot 2  Let f(k) be the number of different arrangements of the prime factors of k. So f(10) = 2 and f(20) = 3. Given a positive number n, there always exists at least one number k such that f(k) = n. We want to know the smallest such k. Input The input consists of at most 1, 000 test cases, each on a separate line. Each test case is a positive integer n < 2^{63}. Output For each test case, display its number n and the smallest number k > 1 such that f(k) = n. The numbers in the input are chosen such that k < 2^{63}. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 2 3 105 1 2 2 6 3 12 105 720
