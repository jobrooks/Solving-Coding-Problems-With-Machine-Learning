Wherever there is large-scale construction, you will find cranes that do the lifting. One hardly ever thinks about what marvelous examples of engineering cranes are: a structure of (relatively) little weight that can lift much heavier loads. But even the best-built cranes may have a limit on how much weight they can lift. The Association of Crane Manufacturers (ACM) needs a program to compute the range of weights that a crane can lift. Since cranes are symmetric, ACM engineers have decided to consider only a cross section of each crane, which can be viewed as a polygon resting on the x-axis. Figure 1: Crane cross section Figure 1 shows a cross section of the crane in the first sample input. Assume that every 1 times 1 unit of crane cross section weighs 1 kilogram and that the weight to be lifted will be attached at one of the polygon vertices (indicated by the arrow in Figure 1). Write a program that determines the weight range for which the crane will not topple to the left or to the right. Input The input consists of a single test case. The test case starts with a single integer n (3 le n le 100), the number of points of the polygon used to describe the craneâ€™s shape. The following n pairs of integers x_ i, y_ i (-2, 000 le x_ i le 2, 000, 0 le y_ i le 2, 000) are the coordinates of the polygon points in order. The weight is attached at the first polygon point and at least two polygon points are lying on the x-axis. Output Display the weight range (in kilograms) that can be attached to the crane without the crane toppling over. If the range is [a,b], display lfloor a rfloor  .. lceil b rceil . For example, if the range is [1.5,13.3], display 1 .. 14. If the range is [a,infty ), display lfloor a rfloor  .. inf. If the crane cannot carry any weight, display unstable instead.
