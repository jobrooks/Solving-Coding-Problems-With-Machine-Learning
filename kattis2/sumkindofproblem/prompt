For this problem you will compute various running sums of values for positive integers. Input The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 le P le 10, 000), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed identically and independently. Each data set consists of a single line of input. It contains the data set number, K, followed by an integer N, (1 le N le 10, 000). Output For each data set there is one line of output. The single output line consists of the data set number, K, followed by a single space followed by three space separated integers S_1, S_2 and S_3 such that: S_1 = The sum of the first N positive integers. S_2 = The sum of the first N odd integers. S_3 = The sum of the first N even integers. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 1 1 2 10 3 1001 1 1 1 2 2 55 100 110 3 501501 1002001 1003002
