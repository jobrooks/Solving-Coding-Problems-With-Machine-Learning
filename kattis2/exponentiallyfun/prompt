In your spare time, youâ€™ve been at ETA building a machine with a function S(X) = N that given a number X outputs a number N, where N is the sum of the prime factors of X counted with multiplicity. For example, S(12) = S(2 cdot 2 cdot 3) = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Your friend Mateusz wants to try your new machine. He gave the machine a number X but you now only see the number N on the display of the machine. What is the smallest and biggest number X that Mateusz could have given your machine, modulo 10^9 + 7? Input Input consists of only one integer 2 le N le 30000. Output Output two space-separated integers, the smallest possible X that Mateusz could have given your machine, and the biggest possible X, modulo 10^9 + 7. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 7 7 12
