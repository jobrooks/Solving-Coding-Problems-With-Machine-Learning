You are implementing an operating system, and now need to write a program to list files in a directory: “ls”. You want the user to be able to list only files that match a given pattern that can include wildcards (*), for example *.c. A wildcard matches zero or more characters of any kind. Input The first line contains a string P, containing 1–100 characters ’a’–’z’, ’*’ and ’.’. This is the pattern. The second line contains an integer N, 1 leq N leq 100, which is the number of files in the directory. Then follow N lines containing the names of the files in the directory. Each line is a string containing 1–100 characters ’a’–’z’ and ’.’. Output The output shall consist of the filenames that match the pattern, P, each on its own line, in the same order that they were given as input. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 *.* 4 main.c a.out readme yacc main.c a.out Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 *a*a*a 4 aaa aaaaa aaaaax abababa aaa aaaaa abababa
