Euler’s number (you may know it better as just e) has a special place in mathematics. You may have encountered e in calculus or economics (for computing compound interest), or perhaps as the base of the natural logarithm, ln {x}, on your calculator. While e can be calculated as a limit, there is a good approximation that can be made using discrete mathematics. The formula for e is:Equations:  e & = displaystyle sum _{i=0}^ ndfrac {1}{i!},  & = dfrac {1}{0!} +dfrac {1}{1!} +dfrac {1}{2!}+dfrac {1}{3!}+dfrac {1}{4!} + cdots ,   Note that 0! = 1. Now as n approaches infty , the series converges to e. When n is any positive constant, the formula serves as an approximation of the actual value of e. (For example, at n=10 the approximation is already accurate to 7 decimals.) You will be given a single input, a value of n, and your job is to compute the approximation of e for that value of n. Input A single integer n, ranging from 0 to 10, 000. Output A single real number – the approximation of e computed by the formula with the given n. All output must be accurate to an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{-12}. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 2.6666666666666665 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 15 2.718281828458995
