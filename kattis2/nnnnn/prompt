Hsara and Simone like to communicate without anyone else knowing what theyâ€™re saying. This time, Simone invented a very sneaky cipher. When she wants to tell Hsara a non-negative number n, she performs the following encryption procedure. Let d(n) denote the decimal expansion of n. Consider the string x := d(n)^ n, i.e., the decimal expansion of n concatenated with itself n times. The encryption of n is then the length of x. As an example, assume Simone wants to encrypt the number 10. Then\[ x = 10101010101010101010. \] The length of x is then 20, which will be the encrypted value of x. Hsara had no problem writing a decryption algorithm for this procedure. But can you? Input The first and only line contains an integer L (0 leq L leq 10^{{10}^6}), the encrypted value of some non-negative integer n. Output Output a single line containing the integer n. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 20 10
