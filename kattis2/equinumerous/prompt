The Modern Arithmetic Puzzle Society (MAPS) has developed a new arithmetic puzzle for its members. This latest puzzle is based on equinumerous numbers. A nonnegative integer m is equinumerous if the canonical base-2 representation of m has an equal number of 0’s and 1’s when leading zeroes are ignored. So, for example, 9=1001_2 is equinumerous, but 6=110_2 is not. Note that MAPS defines the number 0 to be equinumerous, since it has no 0’s and no 1’s in its base-2 representation once leading zeroes are ignored. A puzzle consists of two positive integers n and k. A solution to the puzzle is a sequence of k equinumerous numbers that sum to n. Before MAPS releases its new puzzles to its members, it wants to verify that its puzzles have solutions. You have been enlisted to find a solution to each puzzle, or otherwise report that a puzzle has no solution. Input The first line of input is an integer T, the number of puzzles in the input file, satisfying 1leq Tleq 100. Each of the next T lines contain two space-separated integers n, k, satisfying 1leq nleq 10^{18} and 2leq kleq 20, where n is the target sum, and k is the number of equinumerous summands to be used in a solution to the puzzle. Output For each puzzle consisting of integers n, k, output one line with k space-separated equinumerous integers that sum to n if there is a solution to the puzzle. These integers should be in the usual base-10 representation. Otherwise, output the word “Impossible”. If there are multiple solutions to a puzzle, then output any one of them.
