a sneezing baby panda Alex is taking care of a baby panda who seems to be unusually sniffly. Every day, the baby panda may sneeze out zero or one slime(s) into its enclosure; every night, all slimes present in the enclosure split, so that the number of slimes doubles overnight. Alex places the baby panda into a clean enclosure with 0 slimes at the beginning of day 1 and observes that at the end of night n, there are m slimes in the baby pandaâ€™s enclosure. She is worried about the baby panda and wants to know the number of times the baby panda sneezed out a slime over these n days. Input The only line of input contains the space-separated integers n, m (1 leq n leq 10^{18}, 0 leq m leq 10^{18}, m is even), where n is the number of days and m is the number of slimes present after night n. Output On a single line, output the number of times that the baby panda sneezed out a slime.
