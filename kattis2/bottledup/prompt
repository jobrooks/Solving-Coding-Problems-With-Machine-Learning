Peter is expecting a large shipment of fuel oil, but he has a small problem (doesn’t everyone in these programming problems!). The only containers he has are a set of large bottles (each with the same volume) and a set of smaller bottles (also each with the same, but smaller volume). Given the volume of the shipment of oil, he would like to store the oil in the bottles so that all of the oil is stored, each bottle is filled to the top, and the minimum number of bottles is used. While Peter thinks he has solved this problem for his given bottle sizes, he often spends hours wondering what would happen if his bottles had different volumes (apparently Peter doesn’t lead the most exciting life). Input The input consists of a single line containing three positive integers s v_1 v_2, where s leq 10^6 is the volume of the shipment, and v_1, v_2 leq 10^6 are the volumes of the two types of bottles, with v_1 > v_2. Output Output the number of bottles of size v_1 and the number of bottles of size v_2 which satisfy Peter’s two conditions. If the conditions cannot be met, output Impossible. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1000 9 7 108 4 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 1000 900 7 Impossible Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 1000 10 7 100 0
