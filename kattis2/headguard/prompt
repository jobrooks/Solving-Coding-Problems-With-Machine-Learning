You are the Head guard at the Royal Blue Mountain Castle. Your job is simple: take a tally of how many types of critters came through which doors, and in what order. The castle is renowned for its numerous doors, however sometimes they may or may not be open. Input The input consists of 1 to 15 lines. Each line contains a string of 1 to 500 lowercase English letters. Output On each line output the number of characters that went through in a row, formatted as a number immediately followed by the character. For example, if we have the string “aaaabb” this becomes “4a2b”. If the same character appears twice such as in “aaabbaaa” then you do not combine this to become “6a2b”: since the order is important to the guards, we must keep it as “3a2b3a”.
