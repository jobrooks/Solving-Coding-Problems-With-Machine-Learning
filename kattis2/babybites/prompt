Arild just turned 1 year old, and is currently learning how to count. His favorite thing to count is how many mouthfuls he has in a meal: every time he gets a bite, he will count it by saying the number out loud. Unfortunately, talking while having a mouthful sometimes causes Arild to mumble incomprehensibly, making it hard to know how far he has counted. Sometimes you even suspect he loses his count! You decide to write a program to determine whether Arild’s counting makes sense or not. Input The first line of input contains an integer n (1 le n le 1, 000), the number of bites Arild receives. Then second line contains n space-separated words spoken by Arild, the i’th of which is either a non-negative integer a_ i (0 le a_ i le 10, 000) or the string “mumble”. Output If Arild’s counting might make sense, print the string “makes sense”. Otherwise, print the string “something is fishy”. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 1 2 3 mumble 5 makes sense Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 8 1 2 3 mumble mumble 7 mumble 8 something is fishy Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 3 mumble mumble mumble makes sense
