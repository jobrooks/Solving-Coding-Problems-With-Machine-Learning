Slavko decided to challenge Mirko! He gave him a real number P and a bag full of pieces of paper with exactly one number between 1 and 5 inclusive written on each paper. There is an unlimited quantity of each type of paper. Mirko’s task is to pick the minimum number of papers in a way that the average of the numbers written on them equals exactly P. Input First and only line of input contains real number P. P will have between 1 and 9 decimal places, inclusive (1 leq P leq 5). Output First and only line of output should contain five nonnegative integers – numbers of ones, twos, threes, fours and fives used, respectively. If there are multiple solutions, output any one of them. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5.0 0 0 0 0 1 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 4.5 0 0 0 1 1 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 3.20 2 0 0 1 2
