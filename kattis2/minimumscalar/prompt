You are given two vectors v_1=(x_1,x_2,ldots ,x_ n) and v_2=(y_1,y_2,ldots ,y_ n). The scalar product of these vectors is a single number, calculated as x_1y_1+x_2y_2+ldots +x_ ny_ n. Suppose you are allowed to permute the coordinates of each vector as you wish. Choose two permutations such that the scalar product of your two new vectors is the smallest possible, and output that minimum scalar product. Input The first line of the input file contains the number of testcases, Tleq 10. For each test case, the first line contains integer number n. The next two lines contain n integers each, giving the coordinates of v_1 and v_2 respectively. You may assume that 1leq nleq 800 and -100, 000 leq x_ i, y_ ileq 100, 000. Output For each test case, output a line Case #X: Y where X is the test case number, starting from 1, and Y is the minimum scalar product of all permutations of the two given vectors.
