L-trominos, replicated. The L-tromino is composed of three unit squares arranged as shown in part A of the illustration to the right. The L-tromino is also an example of a rep-tile because four L-trominos can be arranged to make a replica of itself that is twice as tall and twice as wide, as shown in B. Rep-tiles are interesting because, once they can tile themselves, they can recursively tile as much of the plane as we want, as suggested in C and D. Part C is made from four copies of B, and D is made from four copies of C. Figure 1 shows the first quadrant of the plane completely tiled by L-trominos by repeating the same procedure. For this problem, you will be given a square in the first quadrant, and your task is to find the orientation of the L-tromino covering that square. The unit squares of the first quadrant are numbered 0, 1, 2, ldots  in the x- and y-directions, as shown. The dots, in order from left to right, correspond to the first four sample inputs. Figure 1: L-trominos tiling the first quadrant. Figure 2: L-tromino orientations. Input The first line contains an integer n (1 leq n leq 10, 000), indicating the number of cases that follow. Each case consists of a single line. Each of the next n lines contains two integers x and y, separated by a space, with 0leq x,yleq 2^{60}, indicating a particular square in the first quadrant. Output For each case, output the orientation of the L-tromino that covers the given square, one line per case, where the orientations are shown in Figure 2.
