You are given a sequence of n distinct nonnegative integers a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ n. For the given sequence, it is guaranteed that for all nonnegative numbers x, if there is some i such that a_ i  &  x = x, then there is a j such that a_ j = x. Here, &  refers to the bitwise AND operator. Find a permutation b_1, b_2, ldots , b_ n of a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ n such that b_ i  &  a_ i = 0 for all i. If there are multiple solutions, find any such permutation. It is guaranteed that a solution always exists. Input The first line of input contains an integer n (1 le n < 2^{18}), which is the number of integers in the permutation. Each of the next n lines contains an integer a_ i (0 le a_ i < 2^{60}), which is the input sequence, in order of i. All of the a_ i’s are guaranteed to be distinct. For all nonnegative numbers x, if there is some i such that a_ i  &  x = x, then there is a j such that a_ j = x. Output Output n lines, each containing a single integer, which are the b_ i’s, in order of i. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 6 0 1 4 5 2 6 4 6 0 2 5 1
