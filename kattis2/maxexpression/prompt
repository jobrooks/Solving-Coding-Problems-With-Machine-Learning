Image by eminens There is an expression with n question marks, and n-1 operators between them. The operators only include addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Here is an example: ?+?-?*?+?*?*? You are going to replace every question mark with a digit from { 0, 1, 2} . After the replacement, there should be exactly n_0, n_1, and n_2 occurrences of 0, 1, and 2 respectively. Can you maximize the value of the expression by finding the best arrangement of the digits? Input The first line has a single integer n (2 leq n leq 5, 000). The second line gives the expression, with no white spaces between characters. The third line has three non-negative integers n_0, n_1, and n_2 (n_0 + n_1 + n_2 = n). It is guaranteed that the expression does not have more than 50 consecutive question marks with only multiplication operators between them. Output Output the maximum value of the expression. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 7 ?+?-?*?+?*?*? 1 2 4 11
