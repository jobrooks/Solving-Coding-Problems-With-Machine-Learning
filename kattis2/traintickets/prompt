The Stockholm public transport system offers 12 kinds of tickets for purchase. The iâ€™th kind of ticket is valid for exactly i consecutive months. However, they also change the price of every kind of ticket every year. Katriel has access to the pricing data for the last N years, and is currently studying the complexity of purchasing your tickets in order to minimize costs. More precisely he wants to determine, given an interval of years a, a + 1, dots , b, what the cost is to purchase tickets starting from January in year a that are valid every month to December in year b. Can you write a program to determine this? Input The first line of input contains the integer 1 le N le 30, 000, the number of years Katriel has pricing data for. The next N lines contain the pricing data for years 1, 2, dots , N, in order. The pricing data for a given year is given as 12 integers: the prices of the tickets valid for 1, 2, dots , 12 months, respectively. All prices are between 0 and 10, 000. The next line contains the integer 1 le Q le 3, 000, the number of intervals of years Katriel wishes to compute the price for. The next Q lines contains each of these intervals, given as two integers 1 le a le b le N representing the interval a, a + 1, dots , b. In a given year, a ticket valid for a longer period of time is never cheaper than a ticket valid for a shorter period of time. Output For each query a, b, output a single line containing the minimum cost to purchase tickets valid during the entire interval, given that the first ticket is bought in January in year a.
