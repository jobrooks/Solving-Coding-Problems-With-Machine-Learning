You have a list of N numbers, each of the form 2^ a3^ b for some non-negative integers a and b. You want to perform N-1 operations on these numbers. Each operation acts on two numbers X and Y of your choice from the list, replacing them with a new number mathrm{op}(X, Y). After each operation, your list has one fewer number. In this task, an operation mathrm{op} can be gcd  or mathrm{lcm} (they stand for greatest common divisor and least common multiple, respectively). There are a total of N scenarios: You may apply “gcd ” operations k times and “mathrm{lcm}” operations N - 1 - k times. For each of the N scenarios, what is the largest possible outcome after these N-1 operations? What about the smallest possible outcome? Input The first line consists of a single integer N (1 leq N leq 50, 000). The following N lines each contains a pair of integers a_ i and b_ i (0 leq a_ i, b_ i leq 1, 000), indicating that the ith number in your initial list is 2^{a_ i}3^{b_ i}. Output Output N lines in total. On line i (i = 1, dots , N), output four space-separated integers a, b, a’ and b’. The first pair of integers a and b indicate that the largest possible outcome is 2^ a3^ b with i-1 “gcd ” operations (and therefore N-i “mathrm{lcm}” operations). The second pair of integers a’ and b’ indicate that the smallest possible outcome is 2^{a'}3^{b'}, again with i-1 “gcd ” operations. Explanation for sample data The three numbers are 2^03^0 = 1, 2^13^2 = 18, and 2^23^0 = 4. When i = 0, we can only take mathrm{lcm}. mathrm{lcm}(1, 18, 4) = 36 = 2^23^2. When i = 1, the largest outcome is mathrm{lcm}(18, gcd (1, 4)) = 18 = 2^13^2, and the smallest outcome is gcd (1, mathrm{lcm}(18, 4)) = 1 = 2^03^0. When i = 2, we can only take gcd . gcd (1, 18, 4) = 1 = 2^03^0. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 0 0 1 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
