Nick likes satellites. He likes them so much that he looks for them everywhere. One day he found a string of letters and counted a lot of instances of the word “SATELLITE” among all subsequences of the string. However the next day he forgot this string. Can you help him construct such a string? String s is a subsequence of string t if and only if it is possible to delete some (possibly zero) characters from t to get s. Two subsequences are considered different if some character at a given position in t is deleted in one subsequence but not the other. Input The single line of input contains a single integer k (1 leq k leq 10^{18}), which is the number of instances of the word “SATELLITE” in the string Nick forgot. Output Output a string of at most 5, 000 uppercase letters. The string must have exactly k instances of the word “SATELLITE” among all its subsequences. It can be proven that under the given constraints a solution always exists. Note that the length of the string does not have to be minimized.
