“Hey! I have an awesome task with chameleons, 5-th task for Saturday’s competition.” “Go ahead…” (…) “That’s too difficult, I have an easier one, they won’t even solve that one.” “You are given an array of N integers from the interval [1, K]. You need to process M queries. The first type of query requires you to change a number in the array to a different value, and the second type of query requires you to determine the length of the shortest contiguous subarray of the current array that contains all numbers from 1 to K.” “Hm, I can do it in mathrm{O}(N^6). What’s the limit for N?” Input The first line of input contains the integers N, K and M (1 leq N, M leq 100, 000, 1 leq K leq 50). The second line of input contains N integers separated by space, the integers from the array. After that, M queries follow, each in one of the following two forms: “1 p v”—change the value of the p-th number into v (1 leq p leq N, 1 leq v leq K) “2”—what is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray of the array containing all the integers from 1 to K. Output The output must consist of the answers to the queries of the second type, each in its own line. If the required subarray doesn’t exist, output -1.
