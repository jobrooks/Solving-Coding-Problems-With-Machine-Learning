Call a set of positive integers triangular if it has size at least three and, for all triples of distinct integers from the set, a triangle with those three integers as side lengths can be constructed. Given a set of positive integers, compute the number of its triangular subsets. Input The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 le n le 50), which is the number of integers in the set. Each of the the next n lines contains a single integer x (1 le x le 10^9). These are the elements of the set. They are guaranteed to be distinct. Output Output a single integer, which is the number of triangular subsets of the given set.
