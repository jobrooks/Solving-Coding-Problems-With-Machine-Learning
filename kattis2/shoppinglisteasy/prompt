Input The first line of the input will contain two space separated integers: n (1 le n le 20), the number of shopping lists, and m (1 le m le 20), the number of items on each of those lists. Each of the following n lines is one of the shopping lists, containing m space-separated items each. Each item is less than 11 characters long and made only of lowercase English characters. Output Output an integer n giving the number of items that are found on every list on the first line. On the next n lines, print these items in alphabetical order, one item per line.
