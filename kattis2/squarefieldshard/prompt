Note that this is a harder version of the problem squarefieldseasy. You are given n points in the plane. You are asked to cover these points with k squares. The squares must all be the same size, and their edges must all be parallel to the coordinate axes. A point is covered by a square if it lies inside the square, or on an edge of the square. Squares can overlap. Find the minimum length for the squares’ edges such that you can cover the n points with k squares. Input The first line of input gives the number of cases, Tleq 10. T test cases follow. The first line of each test contains two positive integers n and k. Each of the next n lines contains a point as two integers separated by exactly one space. No point will occur more than once within a test case. You may assume that the points’ coordinates are non-negative integers smaller than 64000 and 1 leq k < n leq 15. Output For each test case, you should output one line containing "Case #X: Y" (quotes for clarity), where X is the number of the test case, starting from 1, and Y is the minimum length for the squares’ edges for that test case.
