You are playing hide-and-go-seek in a forest with Belle. The forest has one tree at each of the positive integer lattice points. That is, there is a tree at every point (x,y) where x and y are both positive integers. You may consider each tree as a point. A logging company has cut down all of the trees in some axis-aligned rectangle, including those on the boundary of the rectangle. You are standing at (0,0) and Belle is standing at (x_ b,y_ b). You can see Belle if and only if there is no tree blocking your line of sight to Belle. If there is a tree at (x_ b,y_ b), Belle will make it easier for you to find her by standing on the side of the tree facing your location. For example, suppose that Belle is standing at (2,6). If the trees in the rectangle with corners at (1,1) and (5,4) are cut down (blue rectangle in figure), then you can see Belle. However, if the rectangle was at (3,5) and (5,7) (red rectangle in figure), then the tree at (1,3) would be in the way. Given the rectangle and Belleâ€™s location, can you see her? Input The first line of input contains two integer x_ b and y_ b (1 leq x_ b,y_ b leq 10^{12}), which are the coordinates that Belle is standing on. The second line of input contains four integers x_1, y_1, x_2 and y_2 (1 leq x_1 leq x_2 leq 10^{12} and 1 leq y_1 leq y_2 leq 10^{12}), which specify two opposite corners of the rectangle at (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2). Output If you can see Belle, display Yes. Otherwise, display No and the coordinates of the closest tree that is blocking your view.
