A crate of 24 beers, wastefully arranged. To secure future investment capital, your brewery has decided to improve their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) score by signalling allegiance to the UN Global Goals for Sustainable Development. You have been made Sustainability Commissar. The first thing you will improve is the suboptimal packaging of beer cans into crates. These are currently arranged in a grid-like pattern like this: The area for such a ptimes q packing is 4cdot pcdot q, if we assume that the cans have unit radius. In the above example, the area is 4cdot 3cdot 5 = 60. This consumes resources in the form of wrapping materials, wastes energy for cooling storage space, and emits carbon dioxide during transportation. Surely there is a smarter, greener solution! Any solution that saves at least an area of frac{1}{100} will do. For instance, the 15 cans in the above example are more sustainably packed like this: It can be checked that the area of this crate is 8cdot (4 + 2sqrt{3}) leq 60 -frac{1}{100}, as promised. Input The number N of cans, with 14leq Nleq 100. Output Print N+1 lines. The first line contains the width w and height h of the crate, with w cdot hleq 4 cdot N - frac{1}{100}. The following N lines each contain the coordinates of a single can; the canâ€™s position is given by its centre coordinates (x,y) with 1leq xleq w-1 and 1leq yleq h-1. No two points can be at Euclidean distance strictly less than 1.9999998.
