An arithmetic sequence is a list of values where the difference between consecutive values is always the same. For example, 3, 7, 11, 15 qualifies and so does 25, 15, 5, -5, -15. However 2, 4, 7 and 3, 6, 9, 6 are not arithmetic sequences. Input Input begins with an integer, 1 leq n leq 100, on a line by itself. Following this are n lines, each describing a sequence. Each line begins with an integer, 3 leq m leq 100, giving the length of the sequence. This is followed by the m integer values that actually make up the sequence. Each of the sequence integers is in the range [-10^6,10^6]. Output For each sequence, output a line that says “arithmetic” if the sequence is an arithmetic sequence. Output “permuted arithmetic” if the sequence can be reordered to make an arithmetic sequence. Otherwise, output “non-arithmetic”. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 5 1 2 3 4 5 3 20 6 13 4 5 9 15 19 arithmetic permuted arithmetic non-arithmetic
