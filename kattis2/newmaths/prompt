“Drat!” cursed Charles. “This stupid carry bar is not working in my Engine! I just tried to calculate the square of a number, but it’s wrong; all of the carries are lost.” “Hmm,” mused Ada, “arithmetic without carries! I wonder if I can figure out what your original input was, based on the result I see on the Engine.” Carryless addition, denoted by oplus , is the same as normal addition, except any carries are ignored (in base 10). Thus, 37 oplus 48 is 75, not 85. Carryless multiplication, denoted by otimes , is performed using the schoolboy algorithm for multiplication, column by column, but the intermediate additions are calculated using carryless addition. More formally, Let a_ m a_{m-1} ldots a_1 a_0 be the digits of a, where a_0 is its least significant digit. Similarly define b_ n b_{n-1} ldots b_1 b_0 be the digits of b. The digits of c = a otimes b are given by the following equation:\[ c_ k = \left( a_0 b_ k \oplus a_1 b_{k-1} \oplus \cdots \oplus a_{k-1} b_1 \oplus a_ k b_0 \right) \bmod {10}, \] where any a_ i or b_ j is considered zero if i > m or j > n. For example, 9 otimes 1, 234 is 9, 876, 90 otimes 1, 234 is 98, 760, and 99 otimes 1, 234 is 97, 536. Given N, find the smallest positive integer a such that a otimes a = N. Input The input consists of a single line with a positive integer N, with at most 25 digits and no leading zeros. Output Print, on a single line, the least positive number a such that a otimes a = N. If there is no such a, print ‘-1’ instead. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 6 4 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 149 17 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 123476544 11112 Sample Input 4 Sample Output 4 15 -1
