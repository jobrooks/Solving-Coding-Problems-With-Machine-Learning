You are a judge, again! The contest you’re judging includes the following problem: “You have one L-shaped triomino of each of frac{4^ n-1}{3} different colors. Tile a 2^ n by 2^ n grid using each of these triominos such that there is exactly one blank square and all other squares are covered by exactly one square of such a triomino. All triominos must be used.” Your team is to write a checker for this problem. Validation of the input values and format has already taken place. You will be given a purported tiling of a 2^ n by 2^ n grid, where each square in the grid is either 0 or a positive integer from 1 to frac{4^ n-1}{3} representing one of the colors. Determine if it is, indeed, a covering of the grid with frac{4^ n-1}{3} unique triominos and a single empty space. L-shaped triominos look like this: blacksquare  blacksquare  blacksquare  blacksquare  blacksquare  blacksquare  blacksquare  blacksquare  blacksquare  blacksquare  blacksquare  blacksquare  Input The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 le n le 10), which is the n of the description. Each of the next 2^ n lines contains 2^ n integers x (0 le x le frac{4^ n-1}{3}), where 0 represents an empty space, and any positive number is a unique identifier of a triomino. Output Output a single integer, which is 1 if the given grid is covered with frac{4^ n-1}{3} unique triominos and a single empty space. Otherwise, output 0.
