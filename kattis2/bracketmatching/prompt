Given a bracket sequence s of length n, you are to determine if it is valid! A valid bracket sequence is defined recursively as: “” (x) where x is a valid bracket sequence [x] where x is a valid bracket sequence { x}  where x is a valid bracket sequence xy, where x and y are valid bracket sequences Input The first line of each contains one integer n (2leq nleq 100, 000) — the length of the bracket sequence. The second line of each test case contains a string s — the bracket sequence in the question. It is guaranteed that s only contains ()[]{ }  as characters. Output Output Valid if the sequence is a valid bracket sequence, otherwise output Invalid. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 6 ([]{}) Valid Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 8 (())((() Invalid Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 6 ([}{]) Invalid
