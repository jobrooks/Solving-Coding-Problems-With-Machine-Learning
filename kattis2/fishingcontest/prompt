Ice fishing in Finland. License: CC BY-SA 3.0. Author: kallerna. In a fishing contest, the participants fish in a lake, represented as a 2D grid of dimension r times c. Each integer point in the grid contains fish. At point (x, y), fish first appear at second t_{x, y} and disappear just before time t_{x, y} + k seconds. Outside of this time, no fish can be caught at this position. It takes no time to catch all the fish at a point, and all points contain the same amount of fish. Furthermore, moving to the point immediately north, west, south or east from the point you are currently at takes exactly 1 second (though you are not required to move). Assume that you start at some position (x_0, y_0) at second 1, and can catch fish until (and including) second l. From how many points in the lake can you catch fish, if you travel optimally on the lake? Input The input consists of: one line with the integers r, c, k and l (1 le r, c le 100, 1 le k le 5, 1 le l le 10^5), the dimensions of the lake, the number of seconds fish stays at a point, and the number of seconds you can catch fish. one line with the integers x_0 and y_0 (0 le x_0 < r, 0 le y_0 < c), your original position. r lines, the x’th of which contains c integers t_{x, 0}, dots , t_{x, c - 1} (each between 1 and l, inclusive), the times at which fish appears on points in the x’th row. Output Output the maximum number of points you could catch fish from.
