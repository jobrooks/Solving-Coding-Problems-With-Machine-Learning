You’re making a flag to try to advertise ICPC! The flag takes the form of a grid that is already filled with some “C”, “I”, and “P” letters. A flag is advertising ICPC if there exists at least one 2 times 2 subgrid that looks exactly like the following: IC PC The flag cannot be rotated or reflected. Every square in the grid must be filled with either a “C”, “I”, or “P”. Count the number of ways to fill the unfilled locations on the flag such that the flag is advertising ICPC. Input The first line contains two integers, n and m (2 le n, m le 8), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid. The next n lines each contains a string of length m. Each character in the string is either a “C”, “I”, “P”, or “?”. A “?” means that that location is not yet filled with a letter. These n lines form the grid that represents the flag. Output Output a single integer, which is the number of ways to fill the flag such that it is advertising ICPC, modulo 998, 244, 353. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 3 ??? ?I? ??? 243 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 2 2 IC PC 1
