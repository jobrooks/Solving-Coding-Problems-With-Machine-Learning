Given a positive integer, N, the sequence of all fractions a / b with 0 le a le b, 1 le b le N, and a and b relatively prime, listed in increasing order, is called the Farey Sequence of order N. For example, the Farey Sequence of order 6 is: frac{0}{1}, frac{1}{6}, frac{1}{5}, frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{3}, frac{2}{5}, frac{1}{2}, frac{3}{5}, frac{2}{3}, frac{3}{4}, frac{4}{5}, frac{5}{6}, frac{1}{1}  If the denominators of the Farey Sequence of order N are: b_1, b_2, ldots , b_ K then the Farey Sum of order N is the sum of b_ i / b_{i+1} from i = 1 ldots K-1. For example, the Farey Sum of order 6 is: frac{1}{6} +frac{6}{5} +frac{5}{4} +frac{4}{3} +frac{3}{5} +frac{5}{2} +frac{2}{5} +frac{5}{3} +frac{3}{4} +frac{4}{5} +frac{5}{6} +frac{6}{1} = frac{35}{2}  Write a program to compute the Farey Sum of order N for a given N. Input The first line of input contains a single integer P (1 le P le 9, 999), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed identically and independently. Each data set consists of a single line of input. It contains the data set number, K, followed by the order N (2 le N le 10, 000) of the Farey Sum that is to be computed. Output For each data set there is a single line of output. The single output line consists of the data set number, K, followed by a single space followed by the Farey Sum as a decimal fraction in lowest terms. If the denominator is 1, print only the numerator. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 1 6 2 15 3 57 4 9999 1 35/2 2 215/2 3 2999/2 4 91180457/2
