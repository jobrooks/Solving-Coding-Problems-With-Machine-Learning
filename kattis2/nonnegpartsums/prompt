You are given a sequence of n numbers a_0, ldots , a_{n-1}. A cyclic shift by k positions (0 le k le n-1) results in the following sequence: a_ k, a_{k+1}, ldots , a_{n-1}, a_0, a_1, ldots , a_{k-1}. How many of the n cyclic shifts satisfy the condition that the sum of the first i numbers is greater than or equal to zero for all i with 1 le i le n? Input The input contains at most 110 testcases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first contains the number n (1 le n le 10^6), the number of integers in the sequence. The second contains n integers a_0, ldots , a_{n-1} (-1000 le a_ i le 1000) representing the sequence of numbers. The input will finish with a line containing 0. Output For each test case, print one line with the number of cyclic shifts of the given sequence which satisfy the condition stated above. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 2 2 1 3 -1 1 1 1 -1 0 3 2 0
