You are given multiple problems with three integers p, q, and n. Find sum limits _{i=1}^ n [(p{cdot }i) bmod {q}]. That is, the first n multiples of p, modulo q, summed. Note that the overall sum has no modulus. Input Each input will begin with a line with a single integer W (1{le }W{le }10^5), which is the number of cases you must solve. Each of the next W lines will contain three space-separated integers p, q and n (1{le }p,q,n{le }10^6), which are the parameters of the problem as described above. Output Output W lines, each with the answer for a given instance of the problem, in the order that they appear in the input. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 2 7 2 1 4 5 3 8 10 6 7 37
