Image by AVAVA (Shutterstock); Used under license Students in a boring class want to be able to write notes to each other while removing the threat of the teacher knowing what they are saying if the teacher happens to get hold of a note. Therefore, the students have created a simple way to encode their messages. The encoding involves finding the largest common factor (divisor) of the ASCII values of the characters in each word, something the students call a key, and dividing each ASCII value in the word by this key. The students then represent each resulting quotient in textrm{base }3 (without leading zeros) to form the final encoded message. For example, the first word of the message “Fix it” contains the ASCII values 70, 105, 120, for ‘F’ ,‘i’, ‘x’, respectively. The largest common factor is 5, and therefore the values get reduced to 14, 21, 24, and represented in textrm{base }3 as 112, 210, 220. The same procedure is then applied to the word “it” to yield the textrm{base-}3 values 10220, 11022. Create a program that will encode a message, given as a single string, using the students’ encoding method. Figure 1: The printable characters in the ASCII table (plus SPACE) Input The input contains a message in the form of a single string composed of one or more space-separated words, where each word consists of one or more characters with ASCII values in the interval [33, 126]. The total number of characters in the message (including spaces) is between 1 and 10, 000, inclusive. Output For each word in the message (in order), output two lines, the first of which contains the key for that word, and the second of which contains the encoded word. Separate the encodings of adjacent letters in a word by a single space.
