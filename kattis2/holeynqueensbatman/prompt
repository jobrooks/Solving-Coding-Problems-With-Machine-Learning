The N-queens problem is the problem of placing N queens on a N times N chessboard so that no queen shares a row, column or a diagonal with any other queen. Essentially, we are trying to place the queens without any queen threatening another. For example, the first image below (without holes in the board) is a solution to the 8-queens problem. For this problem, consider the problem we’ll call the ‘holey N-queens problem’. Instead of having an everyday chessboard (of arbitrary size), your chessboard is like the second image above (without queens): it has holes through some of the squares. You can’t place a queen on a square that has a hole, but a queen can threaten another even if there is a hole on the path between them. Given a holey chessboard, you must find placements for the N queens so that no queen threatens another. The third image above (with holes and queens) shows one such solution. Input Input consists of up to 1, 000 board descriptions. Each description starts with a line containing a pair of integers, 3 le N le 12 and 0 le M le N^2, indicating respectively the size of one side of the board, and the number of holes. The next M lines each describe the location of a unique hole in the board. A hole is described by its row and column, each in the range [0,N-1]. The end of input is marked by values of zero for N and M. Output For each problem description, print out the number of unique N-queens solutions that are possible. Two solutions are considered different if any space is occupied by a queen in one solution but not in the other. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 8 0 8 3 0 3 5 4 3 7 0 0 92 50
