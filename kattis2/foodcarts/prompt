Photo from Wikimedia Peter is in charge of food service on a passenger train. The train has n cars ordered sequentially starting from the locomotive. The i-th car has p_ i passengers. There are m food carts Peter may put into service. Each food cart serves a unique type of food. The j-th food cart can move between the l_ j-th car and the r_ j-th car (both inclusive) and serve the passengers in these cars. The passengers on the train are not only hungry, but also adventurous: as long as a food cart is in service, they would love to try it! A passenger will be happy if he/she sits in a car that is served by all the food carts that are in service. Peter would like to design service plans that run one or more of the m food carts so that at least k of the passengers on the train are happy. Peter wants to count the number of different service plans he may choose from (modulo 10^9 + 7). Two service plans are different if one food cart is put into service in one plan but not in the other plan. Input The first line has three integers n, m, and k (1 leq n, m leq 2 cdot 10^5, 1 leq k leq 10^{14}). The next line has n integers. The i-th integer is p_ i (1 leq p_ i leq 10^9 ), the number of passengers in the i-th car. Each of the next m lines describes a food cart. The j-th of these lines has two integers l_ j and r_ j (1 leq l_ j leq r_ j leq n), giving the service range of the j-th food cart. Output Output the number of different service plans, modulo 10^9 + 7.
