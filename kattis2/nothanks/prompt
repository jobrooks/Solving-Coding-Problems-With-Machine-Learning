In the card game “No Thanks,” the deck of cards consists of 36 cards numbered 1–36, and players collect cards to their score pile as the game is played. A player’s final score is the sum of the numbers on their collected cards, with one exception: if a player has collected any cards with two or more consecutive numbers, only the smallest number of that group counts toward the score. Your job is to compute the score for a single player’s pile of cards, though here we allow play with a deck much larger than 36 cards. Input The first line contains one integer, n, representing the number of cards collected. The second line contains n integers representing the numbers on the collected cards. You may assume that 1 leq n leq 90 000, all card values are in the range 1ldots 90 000 inclusive, and no card value is repeated. Output Output a single line containing the score for the given set of cards. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 1 7 5 3 4 11 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 6 2 1 3 8 4 5 9
