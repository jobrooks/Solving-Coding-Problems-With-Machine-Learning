A digital speedometer shows a vehicleâ€™s speed as integer miles per hour. There are occasions when the sensed speed varies between two integer values, such as during cruise control. Using a single threshold to round between adjacent integers often makes the display toggle rapidly between the two integers, which is distracting to the driver. Your team must implement a smoothing technique for the display using separate rising and falling thresholds (t_ r and t_ f, t_ f < t_ r, respectively). See Figure 1 for a graphical depiction of the Sample Input for use with the following rules. Each sensed speed, s, falls between two adjacent integers i and j, i le s < j, where j = i + 1. When displaying the sensed speed s as an integer: When s falls between i and i+t_ f, s is displayed as i. When s falls between i+t_ r and j, s is displayed as j. When s falls between i+t_ f and i+t_ r, s is displayed as i if the most recent preceding value for s outside of range [i+t_ f, i+t_ r] is less than i+t_ r, and s is displayed as j if the most recent preceding value for s outside of range [i+t_ f, i+t_ r] is greater than i+t_ r. Any sensed speed, 0 < s < 1, must display as 1 because any non-zero speed, no matter how small, must display as non-zero to indicate that the vehicle is in motion. Input The first line of input contains t_ f, the falling threshold. The second line of input contains t_ r, the rising threshold. The speed sensor reports s in increments of 0.1 mph. The thresholds are always set halfway between speed increments. All remaining lines until end-of-file are successive decimal speeds, s, in miles per hour, one speed per line. The third line of input, which is the first measured speed, will always be 0. There are at most 1000 observed speeds s in input.\[ 0 < t_ f,t_ r < 1; \ \ \ \ t_ f < t_ r; \ \ \ \ 0 \le s \le 120 \] Output Output is the list of speeds, one speed per line, smoothed to integer values appropriate to t_ f and t_ r.
