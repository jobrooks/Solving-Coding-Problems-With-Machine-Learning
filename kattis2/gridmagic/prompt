Brandon Greg Jr. the number theorist and combinatorist is working on prime numbers in grids. An n by m grid of digits (0 to 9) is called a superprime grid if every non-empty prefix of every row and column (including the full rows and columns) are primes when concatenated. For example, the following is a superprime grid: 2 3 3 3 1 1 3 1 7 This is because 2, 23, 233, 3, 31, 311, and 317 are all prime. Brandon wants to count the number of n by m superprime grids. Input The only line of input contains two space-separated numbers n and m (1le n, mle 8). Output Output the number of n by m superprime grids. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 1 4 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 2 5
