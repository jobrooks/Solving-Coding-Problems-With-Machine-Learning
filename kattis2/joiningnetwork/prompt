A network of size N contains N computers connected by N-1 cables, so that there is exactly 1 path between any pair of computers. The transmission cost between 2 computers is equal to the square of the number of cables on the path connecting the 2 computers. The transmission cost of a network is equal to the sum of the transmission cost between all unordered pair of computers. Given network A with N computers and network B with M computers, the administrator wants to create a new network C, by adding exactly one cable connecting one computer in A and one computer in B. Your task is to minimize the transmission cost of the new network C. Input The first line contains an integer N - the number of computers in the network A (1 leq N leq 50, 000). In the next N-1 lines, each line contains two distinct integers u and v, representing a cable connecting computers u and v in network A (1 leq u,v leq N). The next line contains an integer M - the number of computers in the network B (1 leq M leq 50, 000). In the next M-1 lines, each line contains two distinct integers u and v, representing a cable connecting computers u and v in network B (1 leq u,v leq M). It is guaranteed that each network is a tree. Output Write in one line the minimum transmission cost of the resulting network C. Sample clarification In the first sample below, connecting computer 2 of network A and computer 1 of network B will minimize the transmission cost of the network. In the second sample below, connecting computer 4 of network A and computer 1 of network B will minimize the transmission cost of the network.
