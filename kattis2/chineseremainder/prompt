Input The first line of input consists of an integers T where 1 leq T leq 1000, the number of test cases. Then follow T lines, each containing four integers a, n, b, m satisfying 1 leq n, m leq 10^9, 0 leq a < n, 0 leq b < m. Also, you may assume mbox{gcd}(n, m) = 1. Output For each test case, output two integers x, K, where K = nm and 0 leq x < K, giving the solution x mod K to the equations x = a mod n, x = b mod m.
