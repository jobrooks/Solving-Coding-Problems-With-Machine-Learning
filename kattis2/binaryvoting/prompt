Binary Town is holding its biennial elections. All k positions on its council are open, and as usual Notnomde and Yraglac are the only ones running for each position. Having long since abandoned quaint majority voting, Binary Town uses binary voting instead. In binary voting, all v voters can cast any number of ballots, or not vote at all. The k^mathrm {th} least significant bits of the total number of ballots are then used to determine which candidate wins each position. That is, Notnomde wins position j if the j^mathrm {th} least significant bit of the total number of ballots is 0, otherwise Yraglac wins. You know your neighbours well, and know exactly how many ballots b_ i each one will cast if they choose to vote. For some reason, not everyone is happy with the electoral system so not everyone votes. Thankfully, you also know the probability p_ i of each citizen voting. Since you like Yraglac more than Notnomde, you want to cast the number of ballots which maximizes the expected number of positions held by Yraglac. Suppose there are k = 2 positions and v = 2 voters, and you know with 50%  probability that the voter other than yourself will cast one ballot. If you cast one ballot, the total number of ballots could be 01_2 or 10_2 with equal probability, so the expected number of positions for Yraglac is 1. If you cast two ballots, the total number of ballots could be 10_2 or 11_2 with equal probability, making Yraglac’s expected number of positions 1.5. In this case, you then decide to cast two ballots since that maximizes Yraglac’s expected number of positions. Input The first line contains two space-separated integers 1 leq k leq 16, the number of positions, and 2 leq v leq 100, the number of voters (including yourself). It is followed by v - 1 lines, each containing two space-separated numbers: a decimal 0 leq p_ i leq 1, the probability of voter i casting ballots, and an integer 0 leq b_ i leq 2^ k - 1, the number of ballots voter i would cast should they vote. Output Output on a single line the number of ballots 0 leq b_ v leq 2^ k - 1 you should cast to maximize the expected number of positions held by Yraglac. The answer is guaranteed to be unique.
