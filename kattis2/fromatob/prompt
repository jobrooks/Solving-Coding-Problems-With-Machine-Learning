You are given two integers, a and b. You want to transform a to b by performing a sequence of operations. You can only perform the following operations: Divide a by two (only if a is even) Add one to a What is the minimum number of these operations you need to transform a into b? Input The single line of input contains two space-separated integers a and b (1le a,b le 10^9). You want to transform a into b using only the operations given above. Output Output a single integer, which is the minimum number of the given operations needed to transform a into b. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 103 27 4 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 8 5
