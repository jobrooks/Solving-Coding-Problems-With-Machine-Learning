Diagonals is a pencil puzzle which is played on a square grid. The player must draw a diagonal line corner to corner in every cell in the grid, either top left to bottom right, or bottom left to top right. There are two constraints: Some intersections of gridlines have a number from 0 to 4 inclusive on them, which is the exact number of diagonals that must touch that point. No set of diagonals may form a loop of any size or shape. The following is a 5! times ! 5 example, with its unique solution: Given the numbers at the intersections of a grid, solve the puzzle. Input The first line of input contains an integer n (1 le n le 8), which is the size of the grid. Each of the next n+1 lines contains a string s (|s|=n+1, s in { texttt{0},texttt{1},texttt{2},texttt{3},texttt{4},texttt{+}} ^*). These are the intersections of the grid, with ‘+’ indicating that there is no number at that intersection. The input data will be such that the puzzle has exactly one solution. Output Output exactly n lines, each with exactly n characters, representing the solution to the puzzle. Each character must be either ‘/’ or ‘\’. Note that Sample 1 corresponds to the example in the problem description.
