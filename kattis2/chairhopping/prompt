To perform the dance, n performers numbered from 1 to n and n chairs numbered from 1 to n are required. Initially, performer i is seated in chair i. When a single hop is performed, the performer currently seated in chair i moves to chair s_ i. The values of s_ i are distinct, ensuring that each chair will be filled by exactly one performer after the hop is completed. Exactly two hops have been completed and now performer i is sitting in chair t_ i. Observing that, you wonder in how many ways the values of s_ i can be chosen. The answer can be large. Output it modulo 10^9 + 7. Input The first line of the input contains the integer n (1 leq n leq 10^5). The second line of the input contains n distinct integers t_1, t_2, dots t_ n (1 leq t_ i leq n). Output Output the number of ways in which the values of s_ i can be chosen, modulo 10^9 + 7.
