Suppose you are given a sequence of N integer-valued vectors in the plane (x_ i,y_ i), i = 1, ldots , N. Beginning at the origin, we can generate a path by regarding each vector as a displacement from the previous location. For instance, the vectors (1,2), (2,3), (-3,-5) form the path (0,0), (1,2), (3,5), (0,0). We define a path that ends at the origin as a circuit. The example just given is a circuit. We could form a path using any nonempty subset of the N vectors, while the result (circuit or not) doesn’t depend on the ordering of the subset. How many nonempty subsets of the vectors form circuits? For instance, consider the vectors { (1, 2), (-1, -2), (1, 1), (-2, -3), (-1, -1) }  From these vectors we can construct 4 possible subset circuits using\[ \begin{array}{l} \{ (1,2), \; (-1,-2) \} \\ \{ (1,1), \; (-1,-1) \} \\ \{ (1,2), \; (1, 1), \; (-2, -3) \} \\ \{ (1,2), \; (-1,-2), \; (1,1), \; (-1,-1) \} \end{array} \] Input Input begins with an integer N le 40 on the first line. The next N lines each contain two integer values x and y forming the vector (x,y), where |x|, |y| le 10 and (x,y) neq (0,0). Since the given vectors are a set, all vectors are unique. Output Output the number of nonempty subsets of the given vectors that produce circuits. It’s guaranteed that the answer is less than 10^{10}.
