We say that x is a perfect square if, for some integer b, x = b^{2}. Similarly, x is a perfect cube if, for some integer b, x = b^{3}. More generally, x is a perfect pth power if, for some integer b, x = b^{p}. Given an integer x you are to determine the largest integer p such that x is a perfect pth power. Input Each test case is given by a line of input containing x. The value of x will have magnitude at least 2 and be within the range of a (32-bit) int in C, C++, and Java. A line containing 0 follows the last test case. Output For each test case, output a line giving the largest integer p such that x is a perfect pth power.
