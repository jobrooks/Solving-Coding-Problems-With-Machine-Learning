Little Ivica solves crossword puzzles every day. In case you haven’t seen one, a crossword puzzle starts on a grid of R times C squares, each of which is either empty or blocked. The player’s task is to write words in consecutive empty squares vertically (top down) or horizontally (left to right). Ivica’s sister has a strange habit of looking at crosswords Ivica has finished solving, and finding the lexicographically smallest word in it. She only considers words at least 2 characters long. Write a program that, given a crossword puzzle, finds that word. Input The first line contains two integers R and C (2 le R, C le 20), the number of rows and columns in the crosswords. Each of the following R lines contains a string of C characters. Each of those characters is either a lowercase letter of the English alphabet, or the character ‘#’ representing a blocked square. The input will be such that a solution will always exist. Output Output the lexicographically smallest word in the crossword.
