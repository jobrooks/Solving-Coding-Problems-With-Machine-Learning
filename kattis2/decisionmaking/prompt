After getting introduced to gambling by your friends, you decided to try your luck at the casino. There, you encountered a very interesting game! The game is played with a single coin and a set of n strings s_1, s_2, ldots , s_ n consisting of the characters H and T. The coin will be flipped multiple times until a winner among the n strings is determined. Suppose the sequence of coin flips results in the string v, where v_ i = texttt{H} if the i-th coin flip results in heads and v_ i = texttt{T} if the i-th coin flip results in tails. Then, a winner is determined if there exists a string s_ i which occurs as a substring of v. If no such string exists, the game continues. If there are multiple such strings, then the winner is the string with the smallest index. For example, suppose s_1 = texttt{HTT}, s_2 = texttt{TTT}, s_3 = texttt{HT}, and s_4 = texttt{TTT}. If v = texttt{TT}, then no winner has been determined and the game continues. If v = texttt{TTHT}, then the winner is s_3. If v = texttt{TTT}, then the winner is s_2, since it has a smaller index than s_4. Note that s_1 can never be a winner, since if s_1 occurs as a substring of v, then s_3 will have occurred earlier as a substring of v. In this example, the probability of s_2 winning is frac{1}{8} and the probability of s_3 winning is frac{7}{8}. You don’t believe in the concept of luck, so you decide to compute the exact probability of winning for every string s_ i. Fortunately, you know that the coin is fair, so the probability of getting heads or tails is frac{1}{2} each. It is guaranteed that the probability of winning for each string s_ i can be represented as a rational number frac{P_ i}{Q_ i}, where Q_ i is coprime to 998, 244, 353. You should output the value of P_ i cdot Q_ i^{-1} bmod 998, 244, 353 for each string. Input The first line of input contains one integer n, the number of strings (1 leq n leq 100). The next n lines of input contains the string s_ i consisting of the characters H and T (1 leq |s_ i| leq 100, 000). The sum of the lengths of all strings does not exceed 100, 000. It is guaranteed that the probability of winning for each string s_ i can be represented as a rational number frac{P_ i}{Q_ i}, where Q_ i is coprime to 998, 244, 353. Output Output n lines, where the i-th line contains the value of P_ i cdot Q_ i^{-1} bmod 998, 244, 353 — the probability of winning for the string s_ i. Explanation of Sample For the first sample, the probability of winning for each string is as follows: s_1 wins with probability 0. s_2 wins with probability frac{1}{8}. s_3 wins with probability frac{7}{8}. s_4 wins with probability 0. For the second sample, the probability of winning for each string is as follows: s_1 wins with probability frac{7}{302} approx 0.023179. s_2 wins with probability frac{148}{302} approx 0.490066. s_3 wins with probability frac{147}{302} approx 0.486755.
