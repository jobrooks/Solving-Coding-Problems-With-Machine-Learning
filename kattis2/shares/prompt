Your goal is to select which packs should be bought in order to maximize the profits without exceeding the amount of capital you have. Input The first line contains the maximum capital C that you can invest (0 < C leq 2^{30}). The next line has two integers, the number of total shares N ( 0 < N leq 500 ) and the number of packs P ( 0 < P leq 50, 000 ). Each one of the following N lines describe the N shares. Each line contains two integers a_ i and t_ i representing the current price and the expected price for the next day of the i-th share (0 < a_ i, t_ i leq 2^{30}), respectively. Finally, the following P lines contain the information of the packs, one per line. For each line, the first integer R represents the number of different shares that contains this pack (1 leq R leq N). Then for each share type you have two integers s_ j and q_ j, where s_ j is the id of the j-th share (1 leq s_ j leq N) and q_ j is the quantity of the j-th share in this pack (0 < q_ j leq 2^{30}). Output An integer that indicates the maximum expected profit for the next day.
