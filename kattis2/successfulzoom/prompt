Your boss likes to see numbers going up as proof that your company is successful. To help with this, you came up with the idea to summarize a list of numbers by “zooming out,” that is, to discard everything except every k^{th} number in the list, for some kge 1. Business has been tough lately, with lots of ups and downs. However, if you pick the right value of k, maybe you can prove to your boss that things aren’t so bad after all! If possible, you should find the smallest value of k such that x_ k<x_{2k}<dots <x_{qk}, where q=lfloor frac nkrfloor , and the list x_ k,x_{2k},dots ,x_{qk} contains at least two elements. Input The first line contains an integer n, with 2le nle 10^5. The second line contains n integers x_1,x_2,dots ,x_ n describing the list of numbers. It is guaranteed that 0le x_ ile 2^{30} for i=1,dots ,n. Output If possible, display the smallest value kge 1 for which x_ k,x_{2k},dots ,x_{qk} (where q=lfloor frac nkrfloor ) is strictly increasing and has at least two elements. If no such value of k exists, display the word “ABORT!” Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 8 1 8 2 7 3 6 4 5 3 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 10 9 8 8 4 4 3 10 1 1 0 ABORT!
