Input The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with a line with three non-negative integers, 1 le n le 150, 0 le m le 5000 and 1 le q le 1000, separated by single single spaces, where n is the numbers of nodes in the graph, m the number of edges and q the number of queries. Nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1. Then follow m lines, each line consisting of three (space-separated) integers u, v and w indicating that there is an edge from u to v in the graph with weight -1000 le w le 1000. Then follow q lines of queries, each consisting of two node numbers u and v (separated by a space), asking for the minimum distance from node u to node v. Input will be terminated by a line containing 0 0 0, this line should not be processed. Output For each query, output a single line containing the minimum distance from node u to v, or the word Impossible if there is no path from u to v, or -Infinity if there are arbitrarily short paths from u to v. Print a blank line after each test case. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 3 4 0 1 2 1 2 2 3 3 1 0 2 1 2 3 0 3 3 2 1 2 0 1 100 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 4 2 Impossible 0 100 Impossible
