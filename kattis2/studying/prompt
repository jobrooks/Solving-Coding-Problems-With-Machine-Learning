Photo by CollegeDegrees360 cc by-sa 2.0 It is exam time! You have, of course, been spending too much time participating in various programming contests and have not done much studying. Now you have N subjects to study for, but only a limited amount of time before the final exams. You have to decide how much time to allocate to studying each subject, so that your average grade over all N subjects is maximized. As a seasoned programming contest competitor, you recognize immediately that you can determine the optimal allocation with a computer program. Of course, you have decided to ignore the amount of time you spend solving this problem (i.e. procrastinating). You have a total of T hours that you can split among different subjects. For each subject i, the expected grade with t hours of studying is given by the function f_ i(t) = a_ i t^2 + b_ i t + c_ i, satisfying the following properties: f_ i(0) geq 0; f_ i(T) leq 100; a_ i < 0; f_ i(t) is a non-decreasing function in the interval [0,T]. You may allocate any fraction of an hour to a subject, not just whole hours. What is the maximum average grade you can obtain over all n subjects? Input The first line of each input contains the integers N (1 leq N le 10) and T (1 leq T le 240) separated by a space. This is followed by N lines, each containing the three parameters a_ i, b_ i, and c_ i describing the function f_ i(t). The three parameters are separated by a space, and are given as real numbers with 4 decimal places. Their absolute values are no more than 100. Output Output in a single line the maximum average grade you can obtain. Answers within 0.01 of the correct answer will be accepted.
