If S_{10}(n) is divisible by 3, then n is divisible by 3. It turns out that this idea can be generalized to other bases and divisors. Let b geq 2 and d geq 1 be integers. For any integer n geq 0, define S_ b(n) to be the sum of the digits in the base-b representation of n. We say that DSboldsymbol {(b,d)} holds (mathit{DS} stands for “divisibility shortcut”) if the following is true: for all integers n geq 0, if S_ b(n) is divisible by d, then n is divisible by d. Given integers b geq 2 and k geq 1, find the largest integer d leq k such that mathit{DS}(b,d) holds. Input The first line of input contains an integer T (1 leq T leq 100), the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, one per test case, each of which contains two space-separated integers, b and k (2 leq b leq 10^9, 1 leq k leq 10^9). Output For each test case, output a single line containing the largest integer d leq k such that mathit{DS}(b,d) holds. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 10 5 24 11 3 1
