Photo by Chris Smith. Mr. Lucky has a store that sells numbers. These numbers have an interesting property: each number formed by its first k digits is evenly divisible by k, for k from 1 to n, where n is the number of digits in the number. The numbers do not have leading zeroes. Mr. Unlucky wants to open a competing store. Price for lucky numbers is driven by demand and supply, and given by the formula\[ \mbox{price} = \frac{\mbox{demand}}{\mbox{supply}} \] while demand for numbers with n digits is given by the formula\[ \mbox{demand} = \mbox{citySize} \cdot \mbox{dayOfMonth} - n^ e \] where e is the base of the natural logarithm. Supply for lucky numbers with n digits is simply the number of lucky numbers with n digits. Help Mr. Unlucky calculate the supply for n digit lucky numbers. Input The input is a single integer n. Output Output the supply for n digit lucky numbers. Limits 2 leq n leq 1, 000 Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 45 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 150
