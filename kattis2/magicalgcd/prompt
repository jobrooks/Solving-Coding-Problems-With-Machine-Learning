The Magical GCD of a nonempty sequence of positive integers is defined as the product of its length and the greatest common divisor of all its elements. Given a sequence (a_1, ldots , a_ n), find the largest possible Magical GCD of its connected subsequences. Input The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. The descriptions of the test cases follow: The description of each test case starts with a line containing a single integer n, 1 leq n leq 100, 000. The next line contains the sequence a_1, a_2 , ldots , a _ n, 1 leq a_ i leq 10^{12}. Output For each test case output one line containing a single integer: the largest Magical GCD of a connected subsequence of the input sequence. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 5 30 60 20 20 20 80
