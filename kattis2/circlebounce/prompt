You are standing by the wall in a large, perfectly circular arena and you throw a tennis ball hard against some other part of the arena. After a given number of bounces, where does the tennis ball next strike the wall? Map the arena as a unit circle centered at the origin, with you standing at the point (-1, 0). You throw the ball with a direction given by a slope in the coordinate plane of a rational fraction a/b. Each bounce is perfect, losing no energy and bouncing from the wall with the same angle of reflection as the angle of incidence to a tangent to the wall at the point of impact. After n bounces, the ball strikes the circle again at some point p which has rational coordinates that can be expressed as (r/s, t/u). Output the fraction r/s modulo the prime M = 1{,}000{,}000{,}007. It can be shown that the x coordinate can be expressed as an irreducible fraction r/s, where r and s are integers and s notequiv 0 mod M. Output the integer equal to rcdot s^{-1} mod M. In other words, output an integer k such that 0 le k < M and kcdot s equiv r mod M. For example, if we throw the ball with slope 1/2 and it bounces once, it first strikes the wall at coordinates (3/5, 4/5). After bouncing, it next strikes the wall at coordinates (7/25, -24/25). The modular inverse of 25 with respect to the prime M is 280{,}000{,}002, and the final result is thus 7cdot 280{,}000{,}002 mod M = 960{,}000{,}007. Input The single line of input will contain three integers a, b (1 le a,b le 10^9, gcd (a,b)=1) and n (1 le n le 10^{12}), where a/b is the slope of your throw, and n is the number of bounces. Note that a and b are relatively prime. Output Output a single integer value as described above. Note that Sample 2 corresponds to the example in the problem description.
