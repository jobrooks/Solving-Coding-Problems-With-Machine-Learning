Unown Digits Professor Rowan has been researching a group of Unown in the Solaceon Ruins who have come up with a secret code. Each Unown is shaped like a digit, and they have grouped together to form N numbers (a_1, ldots , a_ N). Their code is the smallest integer c > 1 such that when each of the numbers a_ i are raised to the c-th power, the result ends with the digits of a_ i. For example, if the numbers were 3 and 25, the secret code would be 5, as 3^5 = 243, which ends with 3, and 25^5 = 9, 765, 625, which ends with 25. Write a program to help Professor Rowan figure out the secret code. Input The first line of input contains a single integer N (1 leq N leq 10^6), the number of groups of Unown. The second line contains N space-separated integers a_1, ldots , a_ N (1 leq a_ i leq 10^9) representing the numbers formed by each group of Unown. It is guaranteed that none of the numbers contain a leading zero. Output Output a single line containing the secret code, or -1 if no such code exists. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 3 25 5 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 1 5 2 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 2 5 10 -1
