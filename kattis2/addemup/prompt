Simon is a contestant on the new exciting game show, Add â€™Em Up! In this show, contestants are given a set of cards with multi-digit numbers on them, and need to select two cards that add up to a given sum. However, to make things more interesting, the font that the cards are printed in (see below) means that certain cards will display different numbers if turned upside-down, and it is legal to turn either or both of the cards if necessary to generate the sum. Please help Simon win the game! Input The first line contains two integers, n, the number of cards, and s, the desired sum. The second line will contain n integers between 1 and 100, 000, 000 inclusive. You may assume that 1leq nleq 100, 000 and 2leq sleq 200, 000, 000. Output The output should be a single line consisting of the string YES if two cards can be chosen such that (in some orientation) they add up to s, and the string NO otherwise. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 66 15 21 22 NO Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 63 15 21 22 YES
