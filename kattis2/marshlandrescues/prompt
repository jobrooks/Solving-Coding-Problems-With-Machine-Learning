Image by scanrail (123RF), Used under license The Marshland Accident Prevention Syndicate (or MAPS for short) has just assumed stewardship of a newly discovered marshland. The marshland is made up of areas that are solid ground and areas that are water-logged. Each water-logged area can be modelled by a convex polygon, surrounded entirely by solid ground. Part of the responsibility of MAPS is rescuing any travellers who get stuck in any of the water-logged areas of the marshland. In order to prepare for future rescues, MAPS wants to know how far its first responders might have to wade into any water-logged area. Specifically, for each water-logged area, MAPS wishes to know the distance to any point that is furthest from solid ground, i.e., the greatest value r such that there is a point p inside the convex polygon such that the shortest distance from p to the boundary of the polygon is r. Input The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains a single integer n, where 3leq nleq 10, 000, giving the number of vertices in the convex polygon modelling a water-logged area. Each of the next n lines contains a pair of integers x,y satisfying -100, 000leq x,yleq 100, 000 that are the coordinates of a vertex of the convex polygon. The vertices are given in counter-clockwise order, all vertices are distinct, and no 3 vertices are collinear. Output Output the greatest value r such that there is a point p inside the convex polygon such that the shortest distance from p to the boundary of the polygon is r. Your answer must have an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{-6}. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 2 0 6 0 8 3 3 5 0 2 2.300574391
