Gladys runs a paint shop with a huge stock of paint buckets of various volumes and hues. One of the special features of her shop is that she takes orders of any of the 10^9 colors there are. On the surface of things, this cannot be possible – of course, there is not space enough for at lesat 10^9 paint buckets! To solve this problem, Gladys invented a special device capable of changing the hue of a particular color by 1, 000 color units. This means that if she gets an order for a particular color x, she may instead deliver any of the 2, 001 colors [x - 1, 000, x + 1, 000]. A slight problem remains though – Gladys old inventory system does not support this particular way of fulfilling orders. Your task is to write her a new system, that determines for a given order of v litres of a particular hue h, if the volume of all paint buckets she can transform to hue h is at least v litres. Input The first line of input contains the two integers 1 le N le 200, 000 and 1 le Q le 200, 000, the number of paint buckets and the number of orders the system will get. This is followed by N lines describing the paint buckets. The i’th of these lines contains the positive integers h_ i (1 le h_1 le 10^9) and v_ i (1 le v_ i le 10^4), the hue and volume of the i’th bucket. Finally, Q lines follow containing the paint orders. The i’th of these lines contains the positive integers h_ i (1 le h_1 le 10^9) and v_ i (1 le v_ i le 10^4), the hue and volume of the i’th order. Output For each order h, v, output yes if Gladys can fullfill the order, and no otherwise.
