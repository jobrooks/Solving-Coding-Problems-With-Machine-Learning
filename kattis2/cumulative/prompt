While learning mathematics at school, Hieu amazingly invented a new sequence of numbers. It can be defined as below:Equations:  A_1 & = 1 ,  A_ i & = A_{i-1} + sod(A_{i-1})  Here sod(X) is the sum of digits of X (in base 10) The first few elements of sequence A is [1,2,4,8,16,23,28,38,49,62,70,77,91,ldots ]. Hieu also researched on its cumulative sums. The cumulative sums S of the sequence A is defined as:Equations:  S_ i=sum limits _{j=1}^ i A_ j  Hieu found a way to quickly calculate the value of A_ N but he is unable to find a way to calculate S_ N. Your task is to help him to calculate this value. Input The input starts with the number of test cases T followed by T test cases (T leq 1, 000). Each test case consists of a positive integer N (1 leq N leq 10^{15}). Output For each test case in the input, print in a single line the value S_ N modulo 10^9+7. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 2 10 100 3 231 55041
