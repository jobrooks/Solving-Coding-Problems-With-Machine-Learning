Given a positive integer x, the cube root of x may or may not be an integer. Weâ€™ll define an approximate cube root of x as the positive integer y such that y^3 is as close is possible to x. Input Input has up to 100 lines with one positive integer per line. Each integer may have as many as 500 digits. Input ends at the end of file. Output For each input integer, print out its approximate cube root. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 64 472741006443 65991621053219768206433 4 7790 40410690
