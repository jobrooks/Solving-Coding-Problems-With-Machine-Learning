You are responsible for keeping track of and reporting the results for the runners in a race. You want to develop a software package to make this easier for you. Your program should present the results for all runners in one table, ranking each runner based on their overall time and split times. Split times are measured from the beginning of the race to the split point (e.g. in a 5 km race there may be split points at 2 km and 4 km). You may assume there are always 2 splits per race, plus the finish time. The whole table should be ordered by the runner’s last name, then first name. All runner’s names are unique. One of the issues your program must deal with is collecting the data from disparate sources. Since you have multiple people recording times of runners at each timing location, the information may come to you in any order, and is not grouped by runner. Each timing result is identified by the runner’s bib number as well as which location it came from. You should collect all the information by runner, and organize it as above. Input Input consists of data from up to 10 races. Process each race separately. Each race’s input begins with a positive integer 1 le n le 500, followed by a list of n runner descriptions. Each runner description has a runners name (first name followed by last name) and bib number. A bib number is a 5-digit number (possibly including leading zeros), unique to that runner for that race. Following the runner descritipions are 3n timing records. Each record has three parts: the bib number, followed by the location (S1 for split 1, S2 for split 2, or F for finish), followed by the time (using the format MM:SS). Each name is made of only alphabet characters (a–z). The last test case is followed by a line containing only the number 0. Output For each race, print a formatted table giving last name, comma, first name, bib number, then the time and rank for the two splits and the finish. The name column should be 20 characters wide, left-justified. All remaining columns should be 10 characters wide, right-justified. Each table should have a header formatted as shown in the sample output. If two or more runners have the same time, they should be ranked equally as the highest possible rank, but the ranking for slower runners should remain the same. For example, if two runners tie for first place, they are each given rank 1, but the next runner should be given rank 3. Follow the format of the sample output.
