—“I’m stopping by Žnidaršić’s house, you play the piano, Perica.” —“Ok, dad, I will!” And so, Perica began playing the piano. His piano consists of N keys. Each key has a value written on it, a_ i. When Perica plays the piano, he presses exactly K different keys at the same time. The piano is a bit strange because, after pressing K keys at the same time, it will play only the key with the largest value. Perica is going to play each combination of K keys on the piano and he wants to know the sum of values of the keys that will be played. Help Perica determine the remainder of that number modulo 1, 000, 000, 007. Input The first line of input contains two integers N and K (1 leq N leq 100, 000, 1 leq K leq 50). The following line of input contains N integers a_ i (0 leq a_ i leq 10^9). Output The first and only line of output must contain the required number from the task. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 3 2 4 2 3 4 39 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 5 1 1 0 1 1 1 4 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 5 2 3 3 4 0 0 31
