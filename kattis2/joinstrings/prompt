You are given a collection of N non-empty strings, denoted by S_1, S_2, ldots , S_ n. Then you are given N-1 operations which you execute in the order they are given. The i^{th} operation is has the following format: ‘a b’ (1-based indexing, without the quotes), which means that you have to make the following changes: S_ a = S_ a + S_ b, i.e. concatenate a^{th} string and b^{th} string and store the result in a^{th} string, S_ b = "", i.e. make the b^{th} string empty, after doing the previous step. You are ensured that after the i^{th} operation, there will be no future operation that will be accessing S_ b. Given these operations to join strings, print the last string that will remain at the end of this process. Input The first line contains an integer N (1 le N le 10^5) denoting the number of strings given. Each of the next N lines contains a string denoting the S_ i. All the characters in the string S_ i are lowercase alphabets from ‘a’ to ‘z’. The total number of characters over all the strings is at most 10^6, i.e sum _{i = 1}^{N}|S_ i| leq 10^6, where |S_ i| denotes the length of the i^{th} string. After these N strings, each of the next N-1 lines contain two integers a and b, such that a neq b and 1 le a, b le N denoting the i^{th} operation. Output Print the last string which remains at the end of the N-1 operations. Warning The I/O files are large. Please use fast I/O methods.
