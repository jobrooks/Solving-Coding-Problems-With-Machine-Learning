The coach of Nha Trang University, Mr. Van, has just organized a contest to form its ICPC teams. There were students participating in the contest. The i^textrm {th} student scored P_ i in the contest. The coach wants to form N different teams (each team has 3 students) to take part in the regional contest based on the results from this contest. In his experience, the performance of a team is usually equal to the median of team members’ individual results (i.e. the result of the second-best student). The coach wants to maximize S – the sum of his N teams’ performance. Your task is to calculate S. Input The input consists of several datasets. The first line of the input contains the number of datasets which is a positive integer and is not greater than 20. The following lines describe the datasets. Each dataset is described by the following lines: The first line contains a positive integer N (N le 100). The second line contains 3N positive integers P_1, P_2, ldots , P_{3N} (P_ i le 100). Output For each dataset, output the value S. Explanation for the Sample Dataset One way to form two teams is: Team 1: student 1, student 2, student 3; Team 2: student 4, student 5, student 6.
