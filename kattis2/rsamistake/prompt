An RSA number is a positive integer n that is the product of two distinct primes. For example, 10 = 2 cdot 5 and 77 = 7 cdot 11 are RSA numbers whereas 7 = 7, 9 = 3 cdot 3, and 105 = 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 are not. You are teaching a course that covers RSA cryptography. For one assignment problem, you asked students to generate RSA numbers. They were to submit two positive integers A, B. Ideally, these would be distinct prime numbers. But some students submitted incorrect solutions. If they were not distinct primes, partial credit can be earned if A cdot B is not an integer multiple of k^2 for any integer k geq 2. If there is an integer k geq 2 such that k^2 divides A cdot B, then the student receives no credit. For a pair of positive integers submitted by a student for the assignment, determine if they should receive full credit, partial credit, or no credit for this submission. Note: In the sixth sample case below, the number 545, 528, 636, 581 cdot 876, 571, 629, 707 is divisible by 1, 000, 003^2 and in the seventh sample case below, the number 431, 348, 146, 441 cdot 3 is divisible by 656, 771^2. Input The input consists of a single line containing two integers A (2 leq A leq 10^{12}) and B (2 leq B leq 10^{12}), which are the two submitted numbers. Output Display if the student should receive full credit, partial credit, or no credit for the submitted numbers.
