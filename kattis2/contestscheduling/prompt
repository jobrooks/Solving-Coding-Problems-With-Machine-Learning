A well-known Canadian programming contest is always held on a Friday in October each year. We need you to help choose the dates for years 2019, 2020, …, 2018+Z. There are Fridays when we cannot schedule the contest because of conflicting events. In particular, the contest cannot be held on the Friday before Canadian Thanksgiving; that date is sacred. A list of additional “forbidden dates” is provided, but every year there is at least one Friday in October when the contest can be held. Not all contest schedules are equally good. People tend to expect the contest to be held on or near the date it was held in the previous year. For example, they don’t like to be surprised when they expect a date in early October but the contest runs late in the month, etc. There is a yearly “surprise penalty” for holding the contest on October X one year when it had been on October Y the year before, namely (X-Y)^2, which penalizes big surprises much more than little ones. Your goal is to find a schedule for the Z years following 2018 such that the total of the yearly surprise penalties is as small as possible. Useful facts: Canadian Thanksgiving is always the second Monday in October. January 1, 2019, is a Tuesday. Years have 365 days, except leap years, which have an extra day in February. From 2018 until the year 2400 (exclusive), a leap year is any year divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100. January 1 is the 1^{textrm{st}} day of the year, and October 1 is the 274^{textrm{th}} day of 2018. October has 31 days. The contest was held on October 12, 2018. Input The first line of the input is the integer Z (1 leq Z leq 100), the number of years following 2018 for which the contest is to be scheduled. The second line contains an integer F (0 leq F leq 50), the number of forbidden dates. The following F lines contain the forbidden dates, one per line. Each forbidden date is represented by three space-separated numbers: The first number consists of 4 digits and represents the year. It is between 2019 and 2118, inclusive. The second number is always 10, representing October. The third number consists of two digits and represents the day in October. It ranges between 01 and 31, inclusive. The dates are given in chronologically increasing order. There is no guarantee that all forbidden dates are Fridays. Output The first line of the output is an integer representing the smallest total surprise penalty that any schedule can achieve. The remaining Z lines contain the chosen dates of a schedule with this total surprise penalty, one date per line, in chronologically increasing order. Note that the input data is chosen so that this schedule is unique. Dates should be formatted as in the input: 4 digits, a space, the number 10, a space, and 2 digits.
