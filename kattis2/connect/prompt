When constructing electric circuits one has to connect pairs of points using wire, preferable as short as possible. In this problem we have an empty circuit board of size N times M where we want to connect the two points A_1 and A_2 with each other using one wire, and the two points B_1 and B_2 with each other using another wire. The wires must go along the horizontal and vertical edges of the grid (see figure), and the two wires may not share a common vertex. Determine the minimum length of wire needed to do so. The wire may not go outside the circuit board. Input The first line contains two integers, N (2 le N le 100) and M (2 le M le 100), the grid size of the circuit board. Then follows four lines containing the coordinates for the points A_1, A_2, B_1 and B_2, respectively. Each coordinate pair will be described using two integers and will correspond to an intersection point in the grid. The first coordinate will be between 0 and N inclusive and the second coordinate between 0 and M inclusive. All coordinate pairs will be unique. Output A single line containing the minimum length of wire needed to connect the points, or “IMPOSSIBLE” if it’s not possible to do so.
