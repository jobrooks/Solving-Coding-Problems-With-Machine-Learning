Aivar is very good at number theory. In fact, it is the only thing he is good at, but this doesnâ€™t stop him from achieving great things. However, if Aivar wants to solve any problem in life, he first needs to convert it to number theory. For example, consider a rooted tree with N vertices. In order to deal with such structures, Aivar first constructs a divisor labelling of the tree. A divisor labelling is a way to label each vertex v with a positive integer x_ v so that v is an ancestor of u if and only if x_ v divides x_ u. After constructing such a labelling, Aivar can simply forget about the tree and just think about the list of numbers x_1, x_2, dots , x_ N. You are given a rooted tree with N vertices, and your task is to find a divisor labelling. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N, and 1 is the root. Input The first line contains an integer N (1 leq N leq 60). The following N-1 lines each contain two integers u and v (1 leq u, v leq N, u neq v), meaning that an edge goes between vertices u and v. These edges will form a tree. Output Print one line with N integers, the numbers x_1, x_2, dots x_ N. These numbers must satisfy 1 leq x_ i leq 10^{18}. It can be shown that under these constraints, an answer always exists. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 1 2 1 3 3 4 3 5 1 2 3 21 33
