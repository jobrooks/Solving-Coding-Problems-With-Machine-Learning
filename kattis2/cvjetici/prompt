On a faraway planet, strange plants with two stems can be found. Every plant on the planet can be described by three numbers: the x-coordinates L and R of the two stems, and the height H at which the stems are connected. The following image depicts a plant with L=2, R=5 and H=4. Every day a new plant grows on the planet. The plant that grows on day 1 is of height 1, and every subsequent plant is one higher than the previous one. When a stem of a new plant intersects the horizontal segment of another plant, a small flower grows (if one was not there already). If segments merely touch in a point, a flower will not grow there. The following images are a visualization of the first sample input. Write a program that, given the coordinates of all plants, calculates the number of new flower every day. Input The first line contains an integer N (1 le N le 100, 000), the number of days. Each of the following N lines contains two integers L and R (1 le L < R le 100, 000). The iâ€™th of these lines describes the coordinates of the plant that grows on day i. Output Output N lines, the number of new flowers after each plant grows.
