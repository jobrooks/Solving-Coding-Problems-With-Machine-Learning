Photo by Phrontis, via Wikipedia. Our two lovebirds, Banmuon and Henho want to go on a date. However, they are afraid that their friends or families may find out. Thus, they have decided to setup their dating time using the following secret methods: Banmuon will send Henho a string with format h1:m1 h2:m2 alpha where h1:m1 and h2:m2 represent some time in 24-hour format. alpha is an integer between 0 and 180 and is divisible by 90. Their dating time will be some time between h1:m1 and h2:m2, where the two clock hands, hour and minute, forms an angle equals to alpha degree. However, there is a problem: their dating time may not be unique! Please help Banmuon and Henho figure out how many possible valid dating times there are. Note In this problem, we use a normal analog clock: The minute hand rotates continuously. It takes 60 minutes to make one complete rotation (from 12 to 12). The hour hand rotates continuously. It takes 12 hours to make one complete rotation (from 12 to 12). Input The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 le t le 100) â€” the number of test cases. t lines follow, each line has format: h1:m1 h2:m2 alpha (0 le h_1, h_2 le 23, 0 le m_1, m_2 le 59, 0 le alpha le 180). h_1, m_1, h_2 and m_2 will have exactly two digits, with leading zero if they are less than 10. It is guaranteed that h1:m1 is less than or equal to h2:m2 and alpha is divisible by 90. Output For each test case, print the number of instants when the two clock hands form an angle equals to alpha degrees, between h1:m1 and h2:m2, inclusive. Explanation of Sample input In the first test case, there are 22 instants when the two clock hands form a 0-degree angle. Below are the first 11 instants. 00:00 01:05 and frac{5}{11} minute. 02:10 and frac{10}{11} minute. 03:16 and frac{4}{11} minute. 04:21 and frac{9}{11} minute. 05:27 and frac{3}{11} minute. 06:32 and frac{8}{11} minute. 07:38 and frac{2}{11} minute. 08:43 and frac{7}{11} minute. 09:49 and frac{1}{11} minute. 10:54 and frac{6}{11} minute.
