It is a well-known fact that if you mix up the letters of a word, while leaving the first and last letters in their places, words still remain readable. For example, the sentence “tihs snetncee mkaes prfecet sesne”, makes perfect sense to most people. If you remove all spaces from a sentence, it still remains perfectly readable, see for example: “thissentencemakesperfectsense”, however if you combine these two things, first shuffling, then removing spaces, things get hard.
