There is a group of people in an internet email message group. Messages are sent to all members of the group, and no two messages are sent at the same time. Immediately before a person sends a message, they read all their unread messages up to that point. Each sender also reads their own message the moment it is sent. Therefore, a person’s unread messages are exactly the set of messages sent after that person’s last message. Each time a message is sent, compute the total number of unread messages over all group members. Input The first line of input contains two integers n (1 le n le 10^9) and m (1 le m le 1, 000), where n is the number of people in the group, and m is the number of messages sent. The group members are identified by number, 1 through n. Each of the next m lines contains a single integer s (1 le s le n), which is the sender of that message. These lines are in chronological order. Output Output m lines, each with a single integer, indicating the total number of unread messages over all group members, immediately after each message is sent.
