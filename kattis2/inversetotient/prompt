Eulerâ€™s totient function phi (n) is defined as the number of integers j, between 1 and n, such that the greatest common divisor of j and n equals 1. Given phi (n), compute the smallest possible value of n. Input The first and only line contains the value of phi (n) (1 le phi (n) le 10^{14}). Output Output the smallest possible n such that phi (n) is equal to the input. If there is no such n, output -1. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 6 7 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 7 -1 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 8 15
