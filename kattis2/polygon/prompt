A polygon P determined by points p_1, p_2, ldots , p_ n is a closed chain of line segments (called edges) p_1 p_2, p_2 p_3, ldots , p_ n p_1 in the plane. Polygon P is simple, if no two edges have any points in common, with the obvious exception of two consecutive segments having one common point (called vertex). Note however, that if a vertex is part of any other (third) edge, the polygon is no longer simple. Any polygon that is not simple is called self-intersecting. In two example figures below, the first polygon is simple, the second one is self-intersecting. Your task is to determine whether a given polygon is simple or self-intersecting. Input The input contains at most 150 test cases. Each test case corresponds to one polygon. First line of the test case contains N, the number of points (1 leq N leq 40 000). Each of the following N lines contains coordinates of point P_ i, that is X_ i, Y_ i separated by space, 1 leq X_ i, Y_ i leq 30 000. The last test case is followed by a line containing zero. Ouput For each test case output either “YES” (the polygon is simple) or “NO” (the polygon is self-intersecting).
