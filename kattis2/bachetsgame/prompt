Bachetâ€™s game is probably known to all but probably not by this name. Initially there are n stones on the table. There are two players Stan and Ollie, who move alternately. Stan always starts. The legal moves consist in removing at least one but not more than k stones from the table. The winner is the one to take the last stone. Here we consider a variation of this game. The number of stones that can be removed in a single move must be a member of a certain set of m numbers. Among the m numbers there is always 1 and thus the game never stalls. Input The input consists of a number of lines (between 1 and 100, inclusive). Each line describes one game by a sequence of positive numbers. The first number is n leq 1, 000, 000 the number of stones on the table; the second number is m leq 10 giving the number of numbers that follow; the last m numbers on the line specify how many stones can be removed from the table in a single move. Output For each line of input, output one line saying either Stan wins or Ollie wins assuming that both of them play perfectly.
