Given S, a set of integers, find the largest d such that a + b + c = d where a, b, c and d are distinct elements of S. Input The input starts with an integer 1 le N le 4, 000, the number of elements in S. It is followed by N lines containing the elements of s, one per line. Each element of S is a distinct integer between -536, 870, 912 and +536, 870, 911, inclusive. Output Output a single line containing the maximum d as described in the statement. If no such d exists, output a single line containing no solution. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 2 3 5 7 12 12 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 5 2 16 64 256 1024 no solution
