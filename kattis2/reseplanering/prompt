Alice and Bob spend this summer planning next year’s summer vacation. They want to travel from the old city of A-town to the popular summer resort B-ville, but they haven’t yet decided which other places to visit en route. There are N places to visit in total, numbered from 1 to N. A-town is place number 1 and B-ville is place number N. Some places are linked by one-directional connections; a pair of places can be linked by multiple such connections. Alice and Bob are currently in A-town. Each day they will decide where to travel next by choosing uniformly at random among the connections leaving their current place. Once they reach B-ville, they stop. Alice and Bob want to book their trip back on a day where they are in B-ville with 95%  probability. And they really mean exactly 95%  – no more, no less! There is a 10 day window when train tickets are affordable; if their return trip does no occur within that window they might as well cancel the entire vacation. You are given a positive integer L and have to find a number T with L leq T leq L + 9 such that the probability of Alice and Bob being in B-ville after T days is exactly 95% . If there is more than one valid T, report smallest one. Input The first line contains two integers N and L, with 2 leq N leq 100 and 1 leq L leq 10^6. The following N lines each contain N integers. The jth integer on the ith line contains the number a_{ij} of one-directional connections from place i to place j, where 0 leq a_{ij} leq 10^9. There are no connections from a place to itself. No connections leave B-ville (the Nth place). All other places have at least one outgoing connection, so Alice and Bob will never be stuck. Output Print the integer T as described above. If no solution exists, print -1.
