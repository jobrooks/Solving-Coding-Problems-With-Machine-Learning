We are given a sequence of n decimal digits. The sequence needs to be partitioned into one or more contiguous subsequences such that each subsequence, when interpreted as a decimal number, is divisible by a given integer m. Find the number of different such partitions modulo 10^9 + 7. When determining if two partitions are different, we only consider the locations of subsequence boundaries rather than the digits themselves, e.g. partitions 2|22 and 22|2 are considered different. Input The first line contains two integers n and m (1 le n le 300, 000, 1 le m le 1, 000, 000) - the length of the sequence and the divisor respectively. The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n digits. Output Output a single integer â€“ the number of different partitions modulo 10^9 + 7. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 2 1246 4 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 4 7 2015 0
