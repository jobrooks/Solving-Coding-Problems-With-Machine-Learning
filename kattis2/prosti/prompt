Mirko and his older brother Slavko are playing a game. At the beginning of the game, they pick three numbers K, L, M. In the first and only step of the game, each of them picks their own K consecutive integers. Slavko always picks the first K integers (numbers 1, 2, ldots , K). Mirko has a special demand—he wants to choose his numbers in a way that there are exactly L happy numbers among them. He considers a number happy if it meets at least one of the following requirements: the number is smaller than or equal to M the number is prime Out of respect to his older brother, L will be smaller than or equal to the total number of happy numbers in Slavko’s array of numbers. They will play a total of Q games with different values K, L, M. For each game, help Mirko find an array that meets his demand. Input The first line of input contains Q (1 leq Q leq 100, 000). Each of the following Q lines contains three integers, the i-th line containing integers K_ i, L_ i, M_ i (1 leq K_ i, M_ i leq 150, 0 leq L_ i leq K_ i) that determine the values K, L, M that will be used in the i-th game. Output Output Q lines, the i-th line containing an integer, the initial number of Mirko’s array in the i-th game. If an array with the initial number being smaller than or equal to 10, 000, 000 does not exist, output -1. If there are multiple possible solutions, output any.
