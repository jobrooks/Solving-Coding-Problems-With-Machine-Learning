Input The first line of input contains an integer n (n leq 10000) giving the number of test cases. Then follow n lines each containing 8 integers x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2 x_3 y_3 x_4 y_4, indicating a line segment from (x_1, y_1) to (x_2, y_2), and a line segment from (x_3, y_3) to (x_4, y_4). Coordinates have absolute value at most 10000. Output For each test case, output the distance between the two line segments with 2 decimals of precision.
