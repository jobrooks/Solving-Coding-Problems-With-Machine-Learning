Given is an alphabet { 0, 1, dots , k} , 0 leq kleq 9. We say that a word of length n over this alphabet is tight if any two neighbour digits in the word do not differ by more than 1. For example if k=2, we may only use digits 0, 1, 2. These are the tight words of length 2: 00, 01, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22. There are 9 words of length 2, so the percentage of tight words is 7/9=77.777% . Input Input is a sequence of lines, each line contains two integer numbers k and n, 1leq n leq 100. Output For each line of input, output the percentage of tight words of length n over the alphabet { 0, 1, dots , k} . The output is considered correct if it is within relative or absolute error 10^{-7}. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 1 2 5 3 5 8 7 100.000000000 40.740740741 17.382812500 0.101296914
