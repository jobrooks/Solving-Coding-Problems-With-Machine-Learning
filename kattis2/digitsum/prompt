For a pair of integers a and b, the digit sum of the interval [a, b] is defined as the sum of all digits occurring in all numbers between (and including) a and b. For example, the digit sum of [28,31] can be calculated as:\[ 2\! +\! 8 \; +\; 2\! +\! 9 \; +\; 3\! +\! 0 \; +\; 3\! +\! 1 = 28 \] Given the numbers a and b, calculate the digit sum of [a, b]. Input On the first line one positive number: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case: one line with two space-separated integers, a and b (0 le a le b le 10^{15}). Output Per test case: one line with an integer: the digit sum of [a, b]. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 0 10 28 31 1234 56789 46 28 1128600
