Can you arrange them into a square? You may rotate the panes. The panes should cover the entire square without overlap. Input The input consists of exactly four lines. Each of the four lines contains two integers w and h (1 le w,h le 1, 000), representing the width and height of one of the four rectangular panes of glass.
