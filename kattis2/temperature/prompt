Photo by Jorge Royan. Hello from the future. I am a time traveller. You would think that in the future we have agreed to use a single scale for measuring temperature. This is not so. In fact, we have all sorts of scales now. All the big brands have made their own. This is a bit confusing. Please help me figure it out. In my day to day work I have to relate to two different scales A and B. Help me find a temperature where the two scales are the same, so I don’t have to worry about it. Input Input consists of two space-separated integers, X and Y. X is the point on B where A is zero. Y is the number of degrees in B that equal a change of a single degree in A. Output Output the temperature where both scales are the same. This number must have an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{-6}. If no such temperature exists, output “IMPOSSIBLE” (without the quotes) instead. If more than one such point exists, output “ALL GOOD” (without the quotes) instead.
