The host university is organizing a party for this yearâ€™s ACM/ICPC contestants with a buffet dinner and R boxes of red wine and W boxes of white wine. Wine boxes are to be arranged into non-empty piles, each pile contains only one type of wine, either white or red. After that, those piles are put into a line so that no two piles belonging to the same kind sit next to each other. In addition, for security reasons, each red wine pile should not have more than d boxes of red wine, although piles of white wine can be arbitrarily large. Your task is to identify K - the number of different ways to arrange the given wine boxes satisfying all of the above conditions. Input The input contains 3 space separated integers in one line: R, W, d (1 leq R,W leq 10^6, 1 leq d leq R) Output Write in one line the remainder of K divided by 10^9+7. Sample Clarification In the first sample below, there are 3 valid arrangements: In the second sample below, there are 6 valid arrangements: Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 2 1 3 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 2 2 2 6
