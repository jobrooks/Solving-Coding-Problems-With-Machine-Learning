Gwen loves most numbers. In fact, she loves every number that is not a multiple of n (she really hates the number n). For her friends’ birthdays this year, Gwen has decided to draw each of them a sequence of n-1 flowers. Each of the flowers will contain between 1 and n-1 flower petals (inclusive). Because of her hatred of multiples of n, the total number of petals in any non-empty contiguous subsequence of flowers cannot be a multiple of n. For example, if n = 5, then the top two paintings are valid, while the bottom painting is not valid since the second, third and fourth flowers have a total of 10 petals. (The top two images are Sample Input 3 and 4.) Gwen wants her paintings to be unique, so no two paintings will have the same sequence of flowers. To keep track of this, Gwen recorded each painting as a sequence of n-1 numbers specifying the number of petals in each flower from left to right. She has written down all valid sequences of length n-1 in lexicographical order. A sequence a_1,a_2,dots , a_{n-1} is lexicographically smaller than b_1, b_2, dots , b_{n-1} if there exists an index k such that a_ i = b_ i for i < k and a_ k < b_ k. What is the kth sequence on Gwen’s list? Input The input consists of a single line containing two integers n (2 leq n leq 1, 000), which is Gwen’s hated number, and k (1 leq k leq 10^{18}), which is the index of the valid sequence in question if all valid sequences were ordered lexicographically. It is guaranteed that there exist at least k valid sequences for this value of n. Output Display the kth sequence on Gwen’s list.
