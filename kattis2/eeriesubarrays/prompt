Brandon Greg Jr. considers an array to be scary if its leftmost element is the median of its elements. Given an array with distinct elements [p_1, p_2, ldots , p_ n], Brandon wants to count the number of scary subarrays. A subarray is some contiguous chunk of elements [p_ l, p_{l+1}, ldots , p_ r] where lle r. The median of a set of n numbers is the middle number in sorted order if n is odd, or the average of the middle two numbers in sorted order if n is even. Note that all subarrays of length 1 are scary, and no even-length subarrays are scary because the elements are all distinct. Input The first line of input contains a single integer n (1le nle 2cdot 10^5), representing the length of the given array. The second line of input contains n space-separated integers p_ i (1le p_ ile n), representing the given array. It is guaranteed that the p_ iâ€™s are distinct. Output Output one integer representing the number of scary subarrays. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 6 3 2 1 6 4 5 8 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 7 2 1 5 3 6 7 4 11
