Image from theconversation.com You are given a string s[1..n] consisting of the first 6 lowercase English letters between a and f. A substring is called even if every distinct letter in it appears an even number of times. For example, in abbacac there are 4 even substrings: abba, bb, acac, bbacac. If a same substring appears at different locations, they shall be counted multiple times, e.g. the string aaa has 2 even substrings aa. You are to process q queries of the following two types: Given a range specified by two integers l and r, count the number of even substrings in s[l..r], the substring of s starting at s[l] and ending at s[r] (both ends are inclusive). Given an index i and a letter x between a and f, change s[i] to x. Input The first line of input has a single string s[1..n] (1 leq n leq 2 cdot 10^5) consisting of letters between a and f. The second line of input has a single integer q (1 leq q leq 2 cdot 10^5), the number of queries. Each of the next q lines gives one query: Type 1 query has 1~ l~ r (1 leq l leq r leq n). Type 2 query has 2~ i~ x (1 leq i leq n), where x is a letter between a and f. There is at least one query of type 1. Output For each type 1 query output the number of even substrings on a single line. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 abbacac 8 1 1 7 2 5 a 1 4 6 1 1 7 2 6 b 1 2 6 1 5 7 1 1 1 4 2 6 4 0 0
