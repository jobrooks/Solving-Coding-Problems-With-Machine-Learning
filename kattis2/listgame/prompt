The second player gives a list of k positive integers Y_1, ldots , Y_ k such that (Y_1+1)(Y_2+1) cdots (Y_ k+1) = X, and gets k points. Write a program that plays the second player. Input The input consists of a single integer X satisfying 10^3 le X le 10^9, giving the number picked by the first player. Output Write a single integer k, giving the number of points obtained by the second player, assuming she plays as good as possible.
