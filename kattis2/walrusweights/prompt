Wallace the Weightlifting Walrus is training for a contest where it will have to lift 1, 000 kg. Wallace has some weight plates lying around, possibly of different weights, and its goal is to add some of the plates to a bar so that it can train with a weight as close as possible to 1, 000 kg. In case there exist two such numbers which are equally close to 1, 000 (e.g. 998 and 1, 002), Wallace will pick the greater one (in this case 1, 002). Help Wallace the Weightlifting Walrus and tell it which weight it will have to lift. Input The first line of the input contains the number of plates n (1 leq n leq 1, 000). Each of the following n lines contains one positive integer less than or equal to 1, 000, denoting the weight of each plate. Output Output one integer, the combined weight closest to 1, 000. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 900 500 498 4 1002 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 1 1 1
