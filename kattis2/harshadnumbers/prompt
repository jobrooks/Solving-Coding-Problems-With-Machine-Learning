We’re all familiar with harshad numbers. For this problem, you will ... what’s that? You aren’t familiar with harshad numbers? They’re also known as Niven numbers – does that ring a bell?? Anything??? Well, it’s a simple enough concept. A harshad number is a number which is evenly divisible by the sum of its digits. For example, 24 is a harshad number: the sum of its digits is 2+4=6 and 24 is divisible by 6. 156 is also a harshad number, since 1+5+6=12 and 156 = (12)(13). 157 is NOT a harshad number since it is not divisible by 1+5+7=13. OK, let’s start over. We’re all familiar with harshad numbers. For this problem, you will be given a number n and must find the smallest harshad number geq n. Input Input consists of a single line containing a positive integer n leq 1, 000, 000, 000. Output Display the smallest harshad number greater than or equal to n. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 24 24 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 25 27 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 987654321 987654330
