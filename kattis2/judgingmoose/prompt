Picture by Ryan Hagerty/US Fish and Wildlife Service, public domain When determining the age of a bull moose, the number of tines (sharp points), extending from the main antlers, can be used. An older bull moose tends to have more tines than a younger moose. However, just counting the number of tines can be misleading, as a moose can break off the tines, for example when fighting with other moose. Therefore, a point system is used when describing the antlers of a bull moose. The point system works like this: If the number of tines on the left side and the right side match, the moose is said to have the even sum of the number of points. So, “an even 6-point moose”, would have three tines on each side. If the moose has a different number of tines on the left and right side, the moose is said to have twice the highest number of tines, but it is odd. So “an odd 10-point moose” would have 5 tines on one side, and 4 or less tines on the other side. Can you figure out how many points a moose has, given the number of tines on the left and right side? Input The input contains a single line with two integers ell  and r, where 0 le ell le 20 is the number of tines on the left, and 0 le r le 20 is the number of tines on the right. Output Output a single line describing the moose. For even pointed moose, output “Even x” where x is the points of the moose. For odd pointed moose, output “Odd x” where x is the points of the moose. If the moose has no tines, output “Not a moose” Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 3 Odd 6 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 3 Even 6 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 0 0 Not a moose
