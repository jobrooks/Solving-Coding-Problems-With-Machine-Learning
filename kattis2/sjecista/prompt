Consider a convex polygon with N vertices, with the additional property that no three diagonals intersect in a single point. Find the number of intersections between pairs of diagonals in such a polygon. The figure below shows one such polygon with 6 vertices. Note that a polygon is convex if all of its interior angles are less than 180 degrees. Input The first and only line of input contains a single integer N, 3leq Nleq 100 denoting the number of vertices. Output Output the number of intersections on a single line. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 0 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 4 1 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 6 15
