John wants to put a hidden camera in a room. For this problem, we ignore the vertical dimension and treat the room as a two-dimensional object. The room has the shape of a convex polygon. The camera is placed on a wall, halfway between two corners. The camera has a limited view: the borders of the view are given by the two lines that intersect the wall at a 45 degree angle. John wants to know how much of the room is visible to the camera. Can you help him? Figure 1: The room as described in the first sample. The camera (the dot) can view the shaded region. The limits are given by lines that make a 45 degree angle with the base wall. The area of the shaded region is 71.25%  of the total area of the room. Input On the first line one positive number: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case: one line with a single integer n (3 leq n leq 1, 000): the number of corners of the room. n lines with two space-separated integers x and y (-10, 000 leq x,y leq 10, 000): the coordinates of the corners. The corners are given in counterclockwise order. All angles are strictly between 0 and 180 degrees. The camera is placed exactly halfway between the first two corners in the input. Output Per test case: one line with one floating point number: the ratio of the area that the camera can see and the total area of the room. This number should be accurate up to 10^{-6} relative or absolute precision. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 5 -3 0 3 0 4 5 -2 8 -5 3 4 0 2 2 0 3 1 1 3 0.7125 0.5
