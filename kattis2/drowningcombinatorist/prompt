loglogloglog. Brandon Greg Jr. is sometimes a drowning combinatorist. A permutation of length n can be represented as some order of the integers { 1,2,ldots ,n} . A run of length k in a permutation is k consecutive elements that appear in increasing or decreasing order. For example, [5,2,4,3,1] is a permutation of length 5, where (among other runs), [2,4] is a run of length 2 and [4,3,1] is a run of length 3. Brandon found a way to count the number of permutations of length n that have runs of length at most k. He wants you to do the same so he could check his answers. Since the numbers get very large, Brandon will ask for it modulo some prime p of his choice. Input The only line of input contains three space-separated integers n, k, p (1le nle 2, 000, 2le kle 7, 10^8<ple 10^9+9), where n is the length of the permutations, k is the maximum length of a run, and p is the prime of Brandonâ€™s choice. Output Output one integer representing the number of permutations of length n that have runs of length at most k, modulo p.
