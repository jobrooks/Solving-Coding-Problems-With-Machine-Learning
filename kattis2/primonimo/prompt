Primonimo board game being played. Primonimo is a game played on an n times m board filled with numbers taken from the range 1 ldots p for some prime number p. At each move, a player selects a square and adds 1 to the numbers in all squares in the same row and column as the selected square. If a square already shows the number p, it wraps around to 1. The game is won if all squares show p. Given an initial board, find a sequence of moves that wins the game! Input The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains three numbers n  m  p denoting the number of rows n (1 le n le 20), the number of columns m (1 le m le 20), and a prime number p (2 le p le 97). Each of the next n lines consists of m numbers in the range 1 ldots p. Output If a winning sequence of at most p cdot m cdot n moves exists, output an integer k le p cdot m cdot n denoting the number of moves in the sequence. Then output k moves as a sequence of integers that numbers the board in row-major order, starting with 1. If there are multiple such sequences, you may output any one of them. If no winning sequence exists, output -1.
