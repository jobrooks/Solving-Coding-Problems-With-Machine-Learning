You are organizing a recreational rugby tournament. A rugby team has 15 distinct roles, numbered 1 to 15. Each team in the tournament must have exactly 15 players, each fulfilling one of the roles. Although several groups of friends showed up to play in the tournament, none of the groups are large enough to form a complete team. You would like to create teams by merging some pairs of groups together. Each group has between 1 and 14 players (inclusive) and you know that each player has exactly 2 potential roles they could play on a team. Determine the maximum number of valid teams you can form. A team is valid if it is made of exactly two groups, it has exactly 15 players (no more, no fewer), and every role on the team is played by a different player able to play that role. A group cannot be part of more than one team. Input The first line contain a single integer n (1 le n le 500), the number of groups. Following this line are n group descriptions. The first line of a group description contains a single integer k (1 leq k leq 14), the size of the group. The following k lines each contain two space-separated integers a and b (1 leq a < b leq 15), representing a player that can fulfill either role a or role b on team. Output Output the maximum number of valid teams that can be created by merging pairs of groups together.
