In addition to the empty bottles resulting from his own consumption he sometimes find empty bottles in the street. One day he was extra thirsty, so he actually drank sodas until he couldn’t afford a new one. Input Three non-negative integers e,f,c, where e<1, 000 equals the number of empty soda bottles in Tim’s possession at the start of the day, f<1, 000 the number of empty soda bottles found during the day, and 2 le c<2, 000 the number of empty bottles required to buy a new soda.
