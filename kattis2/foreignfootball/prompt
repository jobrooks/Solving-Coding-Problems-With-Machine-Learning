You are on vacation in a foreign country. This country has a local football league, and you don’t know any of the team names. However, you have found a table of all the results from this season, and next to every match is the concatenated names of the two teams that played. There are n teams in total, named s_1, s_2, cdots , s_ n. You are given the concatenation s_ i+s_ j for every ordered pair i neq j. Find the teams names s_1, s_2, cdots , s_ n. Team names must be nonempty, but they do not need to be distinct. Input The first line of input contains the integer n (2 leq n leq 500). The following n lines each contain n strings, the table of concatenated team names. The j:th string on the i:th of these lines will contain the string s_ i + s_ j if i neq j, and “*” if i = j. The concatenated team names will consist of lower case characters a-z. The total number of characters in concatenated team names is at most 10^6. Output If there is no solution, print “NONE”. If there is more than one solution, print “MANY”. If there is one unique solution, print “UNIQUE”, followed by n lines containing s_1, s_2, cdots , s_ n.
