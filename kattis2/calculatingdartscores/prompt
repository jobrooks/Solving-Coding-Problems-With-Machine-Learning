When the dart hits section i the player scores i points. Each section also contains a double area and a triple area. When the dart hits the double area of section i the player scores 2 i points, and when the dart hits the triple area the player scores 3 i points, instead of i points. When throwing three darts, the player can therefore score a total of at most 180 points by throwing all three darts in the triple area of section 20. Given a target score, output at most three throw scores such that their sum is equal to the given target score. Note that the centre of the dartboard, which is usually called bullseye, is not taken into account is this problem. Input The input consists of a single integer n (1leq n leq 180), the target score. Output If the target score can be achieved, output at most three lines, each of the form “single d”, “double d”, or “triple d”, where d is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), such that the sum of these scores is equal to n. Otherwise, output “impossible”. If there are multiple valid answers you may output any of them. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 180 triple 20 triple 20 triple 20 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 96 triple 19 double 15 single 9 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 27 triple 9
