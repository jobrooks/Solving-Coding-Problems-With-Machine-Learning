The North American Cracker Barrel country store chain offers its clientele a peg game to pass the time until their food arrives. The game is played on a 15-peg board. The rules are simple: each move jumps one peg over another peg into a free hole. The peg thatâ€™s jumped over is removed. If only one peg remains, the player wins. Usually, the game is started with 14 pegs (and one hole). Pegs may have different colors: blue, red, yellow, white, though the color of a peg usually does not matter. In this problem, you are giving a start position of between 1 and 14 pegs of different colors, as well as a target color. You should output whether it is possible to remove all but one peg from the board using the usual rules and end up with a peg that is of the target color. Input The input will contain up to 20 test cases. Each test contains a target peg on a single line, followed by the initial position of the board. A peg is represented as a pair of two uppercase letters, e.g. BB represents a peg of a certain color (say blue). The board is given using appropriate indentation of 4, 3, 2, and 1 spaces for the 1^text {st}, 2^text {nd}, 3^text {rd}, and 4^text {th} row. The input will be terminated by a line containing the characters **. Output For each test case print Possible if there exists a sequence of valid moves such that all but one peg can be removed and you end up with a peg of the given target color. Otherwise, print Impossible.
