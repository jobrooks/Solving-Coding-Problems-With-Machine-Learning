Mirko and Slavko are playing a new game. Again. Slavko starts each round by giving Mirko two numbers A and B, both smaller than 100. Mirko then has to slove the following task for Slavko: how to pair all given A numbers with all given B numbers so that the maximal sum of such pairs is as small as possible. In other words, if during previous rounds Slavko gave numbers a_1, a_2 ,a_3, ldots , a_ n and b_1, b_2, b_3, ldots , b_ n , determine n pairings (a_ i, b_ j) such that each number in the A sequence is used in exactly one pairing, each number in the B sequence is used in exactly one pairing, and the maximum of all sums a_ i + b_ j is minimal. Input The first line of input contains a single integer N (1 leq N leq 100, 000), the number of rounds. The next N lines contain two integers A and B (1 leq A, B leq 100), the numbers given by Slavko in that round. Output The output consists of N lines, one for each round. Each line should contain the smallest maximal sum for that round. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 2 8 3 1 1 4 10 10 9 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 2 3 4
