In Simone, a sequence of lights of K different colours will flash; the player must memorize this sequence and play it back. Simone is such a popular game that it has become a game show played during prime time TV. You are working behind the scenes during a live taping of this show. Unfortunately, the random number generator has stopped working! Quickly, pick a colour that should be added to the sequence the contestant just successfully repeated! You decide to pick a colour that has appeared the least frequently in the sequence. Which colours can you choose from? Input The first line of input contains two integers N,K where N (1 leq N leq 1, 000) is the length of the sequence played so far and K (1 leq K leq 1, 000) is the number of colours available to use. The second line consists of N space-separated integers, each between 1 and K. This is the sequence of colours the contestant just successfully repeated. Output The first line of output contains a single integer M indicating the number of colours from 1 to K (inclusive) that appear the least frequently in the sequence. The second line lists these colours in increasing order with a single space between consecutive numbers.
