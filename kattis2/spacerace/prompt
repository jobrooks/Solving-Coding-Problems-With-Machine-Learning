Anthony and his friends have been arguing among themselves on who has the better space-car. They decided to settle on having a competition on an alien planet to finally settle who has the best space-car. This alien planet is unique as it has no atmosphere, thereby removing air resistance, and the barren land also removes the friction on the car, making it perfect for a space race! To decide this, they need you to make a program which calculates the most efficient space-car. To do this they have given you two formulas! The rate of fuel is equal to the fuel consumed divided by the time taken. The efficiency is equal to the velocity divided by the rate of fuel. The winner is decided by the highest efficiency. Anthony and his friends are counting on you!! Input The first line of input will contain n, where n is the number of space-cars (2 leq n leq 15). The second line of input will contain d, where d is an decimal distance amount from start to end (2000 leq d leq 9999). The next n lines of input will contain the unique initials of the racer (2 uppercase letters), followed by a decimal v which represents the velocity of the ship (100 leq v leq 999), which is also followed by a decimal r that represents the fuel consumed (100 leq r leq 999). All decimals have at most four digits after the decimal point. Output The output should be one line which is the initials of the racer with the most efficient space-car. It is guaranteed that there is only one winner.
