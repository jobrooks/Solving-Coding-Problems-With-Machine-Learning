A traditional Mispelchen is made by mixing a loquat (or sometimes medlar) with 2cl of calvados. You want to enjoy a traditional night out in Frankfurt with your friends. This involves a good meal of Handkäs mit Musik followed by a Mispelchen as a digestif. Sadly, no single pub may have sufficient food or drink to serve the entire group, so you may have to switch pubs. As a matter of decorum, nobody can start their mispelchen before everyone has had their meal. For instance, assume the number h of handkäs and the number m of mispelchen at various pubs in Frankfurt looks like this: Pub h m Schöne Müllerin 4 2 Eichkatzerl 2 2 Friedberger Warte 0 2 Zum Lemp 1 1 Kanonensteppel 3 1 A group of six friends can visit first the Schöne Müllerin and then switch to Kanonensteppel, so that everybody has had their handkäs. Then, still at the Kanonensteppel, a single person can now have a mispelchen. From there, the group has to switch places three more times (for instance, to Friedberger Warte, Eichkatzerl, and Zum Lemp) to find sufficient mispelchen. This took a total of four switches. There is a better way of doing it, requiring only three switches: Schöne Müllerin, Eichkatzerl, Friedberger Warte, and back to Schöne Müllerin. How many times do you and your friends have to switch pubs before everyone has had both a handkäs and a mispelchen? Input The first line includes the number n of friends (including you) and the number k of pubs, with 1 leq n leq 100 and 1 leq k leq 500. Then follow k lines, one for each pub. The ith line contains the number h_ i of handkäs and the number m_ i of mispelchen available at the ith pub, with 0leq h_ ileq 100, 0leq m_ ileq 100, h_1+cdots + h_ kgeq n, and m_1+cdots + m_ kgeq n. Output Output the smallest number of required switches.
