David is looking to book some travel over the world. There are n countries that he can visit, and m flights that are available. The ith flight goes from country a_ i to country b_ i. It departs at time s_ i, and lands at time e_ i. David is currently at the airport in country 1, and the current time is 0, and he would like to travel country n. He does not care about the total amount of time needed to travel, but he really hates waiting in the airport. If he waits t seconds in an airport, he gains t^2 units of frustration. Help him find an itinerary that minimizes the sum of frustration. Input The first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 le n,m le 200, 000). Each of the next m lines contains four space-separated integers a_ i, b_ i, s_ i, and e_ i (1 le a_ i, b_ i le n; 0 le s_ i le e_ i le 10^6). A flight might have the same departure and arrival country. No two flights will have the same arrival time, or have the same departure time. In addition, no flight will have the same arrival time as the departure time of another flight. Finally, it is guaranteed that there will always be a way for David to arrive at his destination. Output Print, on a single line, the minimum sum of frustration. Examples In the first sample, it is optimal to take this sequence of flights: Flight 5. Goes from airport 1 to airport 2, departing at time 3, arriving at time 8. Flight 3. Goes from airport 2 to airport 1, departing at time 9, arriving at time 12. Flight 7. Goes from airport 1 to airport 3, departing at time 13, arriving at time 27. Flight 8. Goes from airport 3 to airport 5, deparing at time 28, arriving at time 100. The frustration for each flight is 3^2, 1^2, 1^2, and 1^2, respectively. Thus, the total frustration is 12. Note that there is an itinerary that gets David to his destination faster. However, that itinerary has a higher total frustration.
