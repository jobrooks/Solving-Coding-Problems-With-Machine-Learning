Georg Cantor (public domain) The ternary expansion of a number is that number written in base 3. A number can have more than one ternary expansion. A ternary expansion is indicated with a subscript 3. For example, 1 = 1_{3} = 0.222ldots _{3}, and 0.875 = 0.212121ldots _{3}. The Cantor set is defined as the real numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive that have a ternary expansion that does not contain a 1. If a number has more than one ternary expansion, it is enough for a single one to not contain a 1. For example, 0 = 0.000ldots _{3} and 1 = 0.222ldots _{3}, so they are in the Cantor set. But 0.875 = 0.212121ldots _{3} and this is its only ternary expansion, so it is not in the Cantor set. Your task is to determine whether a given number is in the Cantor set. Input The input consists of several test cases, at most 10. Each test case consists of a single line containing a number x written in decimal notation, with 0 le x le 1, and having at most 6 digits after the decimal point. The last line of input is END. This is not a test case. Output For each test case, output MEMBER if x is in the Cantor set, and NON-MEMBER if x is not in the Cantor set. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 0 1 0.875 END MEMBER MEMBER NON-MEMBER
