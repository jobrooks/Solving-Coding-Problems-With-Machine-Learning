”Don’t worry, everyone does bad on his tests.” Professor Peggert is famous for his exams with low average / median scores and no extra credit. Despite this, his students’ final grades (usually) turn out okay, as he boosts everyone’s score by grading on a curve. Professor Peggert determines final grades by choosing a positive integer K and dividing each student’s score by K to get a percentage representing that student’s grade. For example, if a student scored 5 on a 12 point exam, and K is chosen to be 10, the student would have received a 5/K=50% . He wants to choose a number K that satisfies the following conditions: At least a quarter of the class should receive a final grade of 90%  (A-) or better; At least half of the class should receive a final grade of 80%  (B-) or better; At least three quarters of the class should receive a final grade of 70%  (C-) or better. Professor Peggert doesn’t want to curve the grades too generously though, so he wants K to be as high as possible while satisfying the previous conditions. Note that the K chosen may be any positive integer, even if the chosen K results in some final grades being more than 100% . Input The first line contains two space-separated integers 1 leq N,T leq 100, 000, where N is the number of students and T is the maximum possible score that a student can score on the test. Each of the following N lines contains an individual student’s test score 0 leq T_ i leq T where T_ i is an integer. Output Output one line containing the highest number K that satisfies the conditions. Output -1 if no such number exists.
