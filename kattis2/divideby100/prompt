Dividing two numbers and computing the decimals is an extremely difficult task. Luckily, dividing a number by a “special” number is very easy (at least for us humans)! We will define the set of “special” numbers S={ 10^ K}  for all non-negative integers K, i.e. { 1,10,100,ldots } . Given a large numbers N and a “special” large number M, what does the decimal representation of\[ \frac{N}{M} \] look like? Input The first line of input contains 2 integers N, M, where 1leq N, Mleq 10^{10^6}, and Min S. Output Print the exact decimal preresentation of frac{N}{M}, i.e. every digit, without trailing zeroes; if the quotient is less than 1, print one leading zero (see sample input). Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 92746237 100000 927.46237 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 100000 100 1000 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 1234500 10000 123.45 Sample Input 4 Sample Output 4 1 10 0.1
