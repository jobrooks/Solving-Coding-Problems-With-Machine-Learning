You are writing an analysis program that identifies textures in black-and-white images. One subroutine in this program is supposed to detect whether an entire row of pixels is covered by a pattern of regularly-spaced black pixels. That is, it determines if every pair of adjacent black pixels is separated by the same number of white pixels. Write a program that simulates this subroutine using a textual input representation. Each row of image pixels is represented by a single line of text. Each asterisk (*) represents a black pixel, while each period (.) represents a white pixel. The following line is an example of evenly-spaced black pixels, since each pair of adjacent black pixels are separated by two white pixels. *..*..*..*..*..*..* The following line is NOT an example of evenly-spaced black pixels, since the two leftmost black pixels are separated by four white pixels, but each remaining pair of adjacent black pixels are separated by three white pixels. *....*...*...*...* Input Input to your program consists of a sequence of lines, at most 2, 000. Each line is one row of pixels to be analyzed. Every line will start and end with a black pixel, and every line will contain only black pixels and white pixels. No line will have more than 1, 000 characters. The last line to process is followed by a line containing the word END. Output For each line, print the line number followed by EVEN if the black pixels on that line are evenly-spaced, or NOT EVEN if they are not. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 *.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.* *..*.*.*.*.*.*.*.* *..*..* * *** *.** END 1 EVEN 2 NOT EVEN 3 EVEN 4 EVEN 5 EVEN 6 NOT EVEN
