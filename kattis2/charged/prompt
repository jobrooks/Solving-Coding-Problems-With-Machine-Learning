Background The electric field vec{E} of a particle with charge q can be derived from its electric potential V:\[ \vec{E} = -\nabla V \] where nabla  is the derivative operator and V at every point in space is\[ V = {1\over 4pi \varepsilon _0}{q\over ||\vec{r}||} \] where vec{r} is the distance from the particle at that point, 1over 4pi varepsilon _0 is some constant, and ||vec{r}|| = sqrt{r_ x^2 + r_ y^2} (in a two-dimensional plane). The net electric potential at any point is the sum of all of the electric potentials from all the particles. The force from particle B on particle A is the charge of A (q_ A) multiplied by the electric field from B:Equations:  vec{F}_{Brightarrow A} & = q_ Avec{E}_ B,  & = {1over 4pi varepsilon _0}{q_ Acdot q_ Bover ||vec{r}||^2}hat{r}  For this problem, however, you will only visualize the electric potential V. Problem Given two kinds of particles, those with a positive charge +e, and those with negative charges -e, display the electric potential at every point in space. The electric potential should be normalized relative to {|e|over 4pi varepsilon _0} (i.e., treat {|e|over 4pi varepsilon _0} as 1). Input Input starts with 3 integers n,m,q where 0<n,mle 50 and 0<qle 10. Then follows q lines: each line contains three values x,y,s, where 1 leq x leq m and 1 leq y leq n correspond to the integer coordinates of the charged particle and s is the sign of the particle’s charge being either a + or a -. No two particles will have the same coordinates. Output Your output should be an ntimes m grid of ASCII characters oriented with the positive y-axis pointing down and the positive x-axis pointing to the right, with coordinates starting from 1. Every character in the grid corresponds to the total potential at that point. If the field contains a particle, print either a + or - corresponding to its charge. Otherwise, the character you place will be related to the sign of the potential. If the potential is negative then use the characters {%,X,x}. If it is positive, however, use the character set {0,O,o} (the first element is a zero). There are 3 tiers to the field’s magnitude: 1 / pi  1 / pi ^2 1 / pi ^3 If the field is below the third tier print a “.”. If the magnitude is above the first tier then you would use % or 0 (zero) depending on the sign, if it is below the first tier then you would use X or O, and so on and so forth.
