Having solved the match issue, Mirko faced another challenging problem. His mom ordered him to read an article about the newest couples on the Croatian show-biz scene in the “Moja Tajna” magazine. The article is written in a very small font size which Mirko cannot read. Luckily, Mirko has a scanner in the closet which will enlarge the article for him. The article is a matrix of characters with R rows and C columns. The characters are letters of the English alphabet, digits and the character ‘.’ (period). Mirko’s scanner supports two parameters, Z_ R and Z_ C. It substitutes each character it scans with a matrix of Z_ R rows and Z_ C columns, where all entries are equal to the scanned character. Mirko realized his scanner’s software no longer works so he needs your help. Input The first row contains four integers, R, C, Z_ R and Z_ C. R and C are between 1 and 50, while Z_ R and Z_ C are between 1 and 5. Each of the following R rows contains C characters each, representing the article from “Moja Tajna”. Output The output should be a matrix of characters with R cdot Z_ R rows and C cdot Z_ C columns, the enlarged article. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 3 1 2 .x. x.x .x. ..xx.. xx..xx ..xx..
