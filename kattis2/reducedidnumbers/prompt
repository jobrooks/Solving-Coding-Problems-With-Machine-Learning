T. Chur teaches various groups of students at university U. Every U-student has a unique Student Identification Number (SIN). A SIN s is an integer in the range 0le sle mathit{MaxSIN} with mathit{MaxSIN}=10^6-1. T. Chur finds this range of SINs too large for identification within her groups. For each group, she wants to find the smallest positive integer m, such that within the group all SINs reduced modulo m are unique. Input The first line of input contains the integer G (1le Gle 300): the number of students in the group. The following G lines each contain one SIN. The SINs are distinct, though not necessarily sorted. Output Output one line containing the smallest modulus m, such that all SINs reduced modulo m are distinct.
