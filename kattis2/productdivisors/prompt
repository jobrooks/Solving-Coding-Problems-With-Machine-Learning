Given a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, dots a_ n, compute the number of divisors of their product A = prod _{i=1}^ n a_ i. Input The first line contains the number of integers in the sequence n (1 le n le 10^6). The second line contains the n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, dots , a_ n (1 le a_ i le 10^6). Output Output the number of divisors of the product of the input sequence. Since this number may be large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 1 2 3 4 5 16
