Given a connected simple graph (with at most one edge between any pair of nodes) with n nodes and n+1 edges (thatâ€™s a tree with two extra edges), answer a list of queries: for two distinct nodes, how many simple paths are there between them? A simple path is a path that does not repeat nodes. Input The first line of input contains two integers n (4 le n le 5 times 10^4) and q (1 le q le 5 times 10^4), where n is the number of nodes and q is the number of queries. The nodes are numbered from 1 to n. Each of the next n+1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 le a < b le n) indicating that there is an edge in the graph between nodes a and b. All edges are distinct. Each of the next q lines contains two integers u and v (1 le u < v le n). This is a query for the number of simple paths between nodes u and v. Output Output q lines. On each line output a single integer, which is the number of simple paths between the query nodes. Output the answers to the queries in the order they appear in the input.
