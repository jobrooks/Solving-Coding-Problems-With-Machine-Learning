Image by Liam Keliher, CC BY-SA Topologically sorting the nodes of a directed graph (digraph) G means putting the nodes in linear order\[ v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, \ldots \] such that whenever there is an edge from node x to node y in G, x always precedes y in the linear ordering. It is not hard to show that the nodes of a digraph can be topologically sorted if and only if the graph is acyclic (does not contain any directed cycles). Kahn’s Algorithm is a well-known topological sorting algorithm. Beginning with a digraph G and an empty list L, it repeatedly executes the following three steps: Let S be the set of source nodes, i.e., the nodes with no incoming edges. If S is empty, terminate the algorithm. Let alpha  be any node in S. Remove alpha  and all its outgoing edges from G. If this removal of edges creates new source nodes, add these to S. Insert alpha  at the end of L. Once Kahn’s Algorithm terminates, if G is now empty, then L contains the nodes of the initial graph in topologically sorted order (such an ordering may not be unique). Otherwise, G has one or more cycles, and therefore topological sorting is impossible. Regardless of the outcome of Kahn’s Algorithm, consider any iteration of Step 1 above. If S contains more than one node, then alpha  can be any one of them, and the choice of alpha  affects the composition of S in later iterations, when further choices may be made that affect the composition of S in yet later iterations, and so on. Taking into account all possible sequences of choices of alpha  during the execution of Kahn’s Algorithm, what is the largest S can ever be at the beginning of Step 1? Input The input specifies a single directed graph. The first line of input contains two space-separated integers, n and m (1 leq n leq 500, 0 leq m leq n(n-1)), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges. This is followed by m lines, each containing two space-separated integers, x and y (0 leq x,y leq (n-1), x neq y), indicating that there is a directed edge from node x to node y, where nodes are indexed 0, 1, 2, ldots , (n-1). No edge will be listed more than once. Output Output a line containing a single integer: the largest possible size of S at the beginning of any iteration of Step 1 in the execution of Kahn’s Algorithm.
