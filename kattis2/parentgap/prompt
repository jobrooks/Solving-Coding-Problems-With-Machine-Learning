The interval between Mother’s Day and Father’s Day in any particular year, sometimes referred to as the parent gap, is always either 5 weeks or 6 weeks. For example, in 2022 Mother’s Day was on May 8 and Father’s Day was on June 19, a parent gap of 6 weeks, but in 2023 Mother’s Day will be on May 14 and Father’s Day will be on June 18, a parent gap of only 5 weeks. Your task is to determine the parent gap for a given year. The following information may be helpful. In a year that is not a leap year, the months have the following number of days: January: 31, February: 28, March: 31, April: 30, May: 31, June: 30, July: 31, August: 31, September: 30, October: 31, November: 30, December: 31. In a leap year, February has an extra day (February 29^{textrm{th}}), and the Leap Year Rule is as follow: a year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year, unless it is divisible by 100, with the exception (to the exception) that a year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year. Input Input consists of a single year, y (2, 000 leq y leq 3, 000). Output Output the parent gap for the input year, either “5 weeks” or “6 weeks”. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2022 6 weeks Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 2023 5 weeks
