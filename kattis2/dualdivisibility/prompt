Given two positive integers a and b with the same number of digits, compute the number of divisors of a that have b as a divisor. Input The first and only line contains the integers a and b (1 le b le a le 10^{18}). Output Output the number of divisors of a that have b as a divisor. Explanation of sample 1 In the first example, the four divisors are 12, 24, 48, 96. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 96 12 4
