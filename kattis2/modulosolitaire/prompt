Modulo Solitaire is a game that can be played when you are bored. You can even play it without a phone, just on paper. First, you pick a number m. Then you pick two sequences of numbers a_{i} and b_{i}. Finally, you pick a starting number s_{0}. Now, your goal is to go from s_{0} to 0 in as few moves as possible. In each move, you choose an i, then multiply your current number by a_{i}, add b_{i} to it, and reduce the result modulo m. That is, s_{j} = (s_{j-1} cdot a_{i_{j}} + b_{i_{j}}) bmod {m}. Input The first line of input contains three integers 1 le m le 10^6, 0 le n le 10, and 1 le s_{0} < m. The next n lines each contain two integers, a pair 0 le a_ i le 10^9 and 0 le b_ i le 10^9. Output Output a single integer, the minimum number of moves needed to reach 0 starting from s_0. If it is not possible to reach 0 in any number of moves, output -1.
