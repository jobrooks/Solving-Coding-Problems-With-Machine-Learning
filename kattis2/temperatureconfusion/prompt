Yraglac has been a bit bored with Calgary lately and decided to move to the United States. After arriving in the strange land, he discovered that the people there use a temperature scale known as Fahrenheit. Celsius and Fahrenheit are related by the following equation:\[ \left[ ^\circ F \right] = \frac95 \left[ ^\circ C \right] + 32 \] It is your job to help Yraglac convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. When it comes to temperatures, however, Yraglac is a bit particular. Given a temperature expressed as a fraction in Fahrenheit, he wants to know the exact value in Celsius, expressed as a fraction in lowest terms. Input The input consists of a single test case representing a fractional number in Fahrenheit. It will be in the form a/b or -a/b where a and b are integers such that 0 leq a, b leq 1, 000, 000 and b neq 0. Note that the input is not guaranteed to be a fraction in lowest terms. You should consider temperatures below absolute zero to be valid. Output Output a single line with the exact result of converting the temperature to Celsius, expressed as a fraction in lowest terms (that is, gcd (a,b) = 1). Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 32/1 0/1 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 33/1 5/9 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 -40/1 -40/1 Sample Input 4 Sample Output 4 -84/9 -620/27
