Woman drinking Jax Beer at Raceland Crab Boil, 1938. Photo: Russell Lee. Alice and Bob have challenged each other to finish as many bottles as quickly as they can, an activity known as chugging in North American slang. It takes Alice t_ A seconds to finish the first bottle. However, the bottle contents (gas, complex carbohydrates, alcohol) have deleterious effects on performance, so the second bottle takes her t_ A+d_ A seconds to finish. This effect is cumulative: with every new bottle, Alice’s chugging speed deteriorates by d_ A additional seconds. For instance, if t_ A=10 and d_ A=2 as in the sample inputs below, then Alice needs\[ 10 + (10 + 2) + (10 + 2 + 2)=36 \] seconds to finish 3 bottles. The corresponding values for Bob are t_ B and d_ B. Who finishes first? Input The input consists of three lines. The first line contains the number N of bottles they each have to finish, with 1leq N leq 10. The second line contains the integers t_ A and d_ A, with 1leq t_ Aleq 120 and 0leq d_ Aleq 120. The third line contains the integers t_ B and d_ B, with 1leq t_ Bleq 120 and 0leq d_ Bleq 120. Output Print “Alice” if Alice finishes first, or “Bob” if Bob finishes first. If they finish at the same time, print an equality symbol, “=”.
