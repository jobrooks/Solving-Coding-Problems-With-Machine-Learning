Nicole is a retired wealthy businesswoman who is interested in donating to her favorite charity while maintaining the maximum wealth possible. She currently has X dollars in the bank and would like to donate Y dollars to the charity each year over the next N years. The amount donated in any particular year does not need to be exactly Y dollars, but for any 1 leq i leq N, the total sum donated in the first i years must be at least i cdot Y dollars. At the start of each of the N years, Nicole can donate any amount of money to the charity, or none at all. Donations cannot be made at any other time of the year. If she donates more than Z dollars in a single year, she will receive a tax credit of C%  on the amount over Z dollars. The tax credit is immediately deposited into her bank account upon making the donation. Currently, it is the start of year 1. Money in Nicoleâ€™s bank account grows at an interest rate of R%  compounded annually. That is, if the money in her account is m dollars at the start of a year (after she possibly donates and receives tax credits), the money at the end of the year (and the start of the next year) will be m cdot (1+R/100) dollars. Help Nicole find the maximum amount of money she could have at the end of year N while donating to her favorite charity in the manner described. Input The input consists of 6 integers N, X, Y, Z, C, R as described above. (1leq Nleq 300, Ycdot Nleq Xleq 10^9, 1leq Yleq 10^9, 0leq Zleq 10^9, 0 leq C leq 100, 0 leq R leq 100) Output Output a single number with the answer. The answer is guaranteed to be a non-negative number not exceeding 10^{18}. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-6}.
