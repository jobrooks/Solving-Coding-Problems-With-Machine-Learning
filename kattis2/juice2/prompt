You are holding a party. In preparation, you are making a drink by mixing together three different types of fruit juice: Apple, Banana, and Carrot. Let’s name the juices A, B and C. You want to decide what fraction of the drink should be made from each type of juice, in such a way that the maximum possible number of people attending the party like it. Each person has a minimum fraction of each of the 3 juices they would like to have in the drink. They will only like the drink if the fraction of each of the 3 juices in the drink is greater or equal to their minimum fraction for that juice. Determine the maximum number of people that you can satisfy. Input One line containing an integer T, the number of test cases in the input file. For each test case, there will be: One line containing the integer N, the number of people going to the party. N lines, one for each person, each containing three space-separated numbers “A B C”, indicating the minimum fraction of each juice that would like in the drink. A, B and C are integers between 0 and 10, 000 inclusive, indicating the fraction in parts-per-ten-thousand. A + B + C leq 10, 000. You may assume that 1 leq T leq 2 and 1 leq N leq 5, 000. Output T lines, one for each test case in the order they occur in the input file, each containing the string “Case #X: Y” where X is the number of the test case, starting from 1, and Y is the maximum number of people who will like your drink.
