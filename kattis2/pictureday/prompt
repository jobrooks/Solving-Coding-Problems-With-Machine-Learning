The school for applied astrology has decided to take pictures of all their students. With moon phases being what they are, combined with Saturn’s position relative to Venus, they are forced to focus on cost. In order to minimise cost, they have asked three photographers for their price and process. Photographer A wants to take G_ a group photos costing a per photo. Photographer B wants to take G_ b group photos costing b per photo. Photographer C wants to take photos with one student in each photo, costing c per photo. Each student will be in exactly one of A’s groups and exactly one of B’s groups. The three photographers are pretty flexible, so they will allow the school to choose some pictures from each if they want to. What is the lowest price they have to pay so that each student will be in at least one picture? Input The first line of the input consists of a single integer N, the number of students in the school. The second line consists of two space-separated integers, G_ a, G_ b, representing the number of groups for photographers A and B. The third line consists of the three space-separated integers a, b, c, representing the prices of the tree photographers. The next G_ a lines represent photographer A’s groups, and consist of an integer G_{ai}, representing the number of students in that group, followed by G_{ai} space-separated integers S_ j, representing the student numbers in that group. The next G_ b lines represent photographer B’s groups, and consist of an integer G_{bi}, representing the number of students in that group, followed by G_{bi} space-separated integers S_ j, representing the student numbers in that group. Output The output should be a single integer representing the cost of photographing all students at least once.
