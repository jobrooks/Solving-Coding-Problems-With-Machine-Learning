An integer m is a rotated number of some integer n if m can be obtained by moving some digits from the back of n to the front without changing their order. In this case, (n,m) is considered as a rotated pair. For example, (1234,4123) is a rotated pair since you can obtain 4123 by moving 4 from the back of 1234 to the front. Note that both n and m do not contain leading zeros. Given two integers A and B, your task is to count the number of distinct rotated pairs (n,m) with {A leq n < m leq B}. Input The input consists of several datasets. The first line of the input contains the number of datasets, which is not greater than 100. The following lines describe the datasets. Each dataset is printed in one line containing two integers A and B ({1 leq A < B leq 10^6}). Output For each dataset, write out on one line the number of rotated pairs. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 1 10 10 50 0 6
