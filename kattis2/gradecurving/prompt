An instructor may use curved score to grade a student’s performance. Assume a student’s original score is x out of a total of 100. One of the curving methods is to apply to x the curving function f(x) = 10sqrt {x}. The function may be applied k geq 0 times. For better score readability, the result is rounded to the next integer and the final curved score is y = lceil f^ k(x) rceil . For example, if the curving function is applied k = 3 times to x = 80, it changes the score toEquations:  f^3(80) & = f^2(f(80)) = f^2(89.4427) ,  & = f(f(89.4427)) = f(94.5742) = 97.2492.  So the curved score is y = lceil 97.2492 rceil = 98. John wants to curve a student’s score x using this method so that the curved score y is between y_{low} and y_{high}. How many times should he apply the curving function? In particular, what are the minimum and maximum choices of k, so that y_{low} leq y leq y_{high}? Input The input has a single line with three integers: x, y_{low}, and y_{high} (1 leq x leq y_{low} leq y_{high} leq 100). Output Output the minimum and maximum possible choices of k. If the curving function can be applied an infinite number of times, output “inf” for the maximum. If there is no k that meets the curving requirement, output a single word “impossible”. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 80 85 98 1 3 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 98 98 100 0 inf Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 80 85 89 impossible
