A Hill Number is a positive integer, the digits of which possibly rise and then possibly fall, but never fall and then rise. For example: 12321 is a hill number. 12223 is a hill number. 33322111 is a hill number. 1232321 is not a hill number. Given a positive integer, if it is a hill number, print the number of positive hill numbers less than or equal to it. If it is not a hill number, print -1. Input Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each test case will consist of a single integer n (1 le n le 10^{18}). Output Output a single line with a single integer. If the input is a hill number, then output the number of hill numbers less than or equal to it. If the input is not a hill number, then output -1.
