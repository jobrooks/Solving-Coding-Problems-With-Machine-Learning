You are given a list of integers x_1, x_2, ldots , x_ n and a number k. It is guaranteed that each i from 1 to k appears in the list at least once. Find the lexicographically smallest subsequence of x that contains each integer from 1 to k exactly once. Input The first line contains two integers n and k, with 1le kle nle 200, 000. The following n lines each contain an integer x_ i with 1le x_ ile k. Output Write out on one line, separated by spaces, the lexicographically smallest subsequence of x that has each integer from 1 to k exactly once.
