Input The first line of input consists of two integers N and Q, where 1 le N le 1, 000, 000 is the number of elements in the base set and 0 le Q le 1, 000, 000 is the number of operations. Then follow Q lines, one per operation. There are two types of operations: “= a b” indicate that the sets containing a and b are joined “? a b” is a query asking whether a and b belong to the same set In both cases, a and b are distinct integers between 0 and N-1. Output For each query output a line containing “yes” if a and b are in the same set, and “no” otherwise. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 10 4 ? 1 3 = 1 8 = 3 8 ? 1 3 no yes Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 4 5 ? 0 0 = 0 1 = 1 2 = 0 2 ? 0 3 yes no
