The Fibonacci sequence can be defined as follows:Equations:  mathrm{fib}_1 & = 1 ,  mathrm{fib}_2 & = 1 ,  mathrm{fib}_ n & = mathrm{fib}_{n-2} + mathrm{fib}_{n-1}  We get the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ldots . But there are many generalizations of the Fibonacci sequence. One of them is to start with other numbers, like:Equations:  f_1 & = 5 ,  f_2 & = 4 ,  f_ n & = f_{n-2} + f_{n-1}  And we get the sequence 5, 4, 9, 13, 22, 35, 57, ldots . But what if we start with something other than numbers? Let us define the Batmanacci sequence in the following manner:Equations:  s_1 & = texttt{N} ,  s_2 & = texttt{A} ,  s_ n & = s_{n-2} + s_{n-1}  where + is string concatenation. Now we get the sequence N, A, NA, ANA, NAANA, â€¦. Given N and K, what is the K-th letter in the N-th string in the Batmanacci sequence? Input Input consists of a single line containing two integers N (1 leq N leq 10^5) and K (1 leq K leq 10^{18}). It is guaranteed that K is at most the length of the N-th string in the Batmanacci sequence. Output Output the K-th letter in the N-th string in the Batmanacci sequence. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 7 7 N Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 777 777 A
