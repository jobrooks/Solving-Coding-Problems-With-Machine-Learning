VisuAlgo (http://visualgo.net) is a website developed by a team of staff and students of School of Computing, National University of Singapore, the host of the 2015 ACM-ICPC Asia Singapore Regional. VisuAlgo visualizes a number of popular data structures and algorithms in the Computer Science curriculum. Currently, it receives approximately 2000 hits/day from CS students and instructors worldwide. One new feature of VisuAlgo is the online quiz. As an example, the above figure shows a question about the classic Single-Source (Single-Destination) Shortest Paths problem in graph theory. The beauty of this online quiz feature is that the question parameters are randomized. The drawn graph G is taken from a collection of hundreds of directed weighted graphs (with their 2-D layouts) in VisuAlgo’s internal database. The graph G has V vertices numbered from [0..V-1]. The source vertex s and the destination vertex t are selected at random from [0..V-1]. However, such randomization of the question parameters may produce either a trivial question (e.g. “No Answer” when s and t are disconnected, 0 when s = t, simple tracing of a path if there is only a single unique path from s to t as shown in the above figure) or insanely difficult question to be computed manually if there are too many possible shortest paths from s to t. The developers of VisuAlgo want to calibrate such Shortest Paths question with randomized parameters so that it is possible for a normal Computer Science student to answer the randomly generated question manually within a reasonable amount of time. Please help them. Input The first line of input contains two non-negative integers 1 leq V leq 10, 000 and 0 leq E leq 200, 000, giving the number of vertices and edges of the drawn graph G. Thereafter follow E lines, each describing the directed weighted edges in G by three integers 0 leq u, v leq V-1 and 1 leq w leq 99 (VisuAlgo limits the edge weight to be at most 2 characters for visual aesthetic purpose), where u and v are the vertex numbers and w is the weight of the directed edge u rightarrow v. It is guaranteed that G is a simple graph without self-loops or multiple directed edges with the same direction between the same pair of vertices. Finally, there are two integers in the last line of input 0 leq s, t leq V-1. Output Print a line with the number of different shortest paths between s to t in G. Two shortest paths p_1 and p_2 are considered different if there exists at least one edge in p_1 that is not found in p_2. It is guaranteed that the answer fits in a 32-bit signed integer data type.
