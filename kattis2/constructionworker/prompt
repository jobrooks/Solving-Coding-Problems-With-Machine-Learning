SoCCat the Construction Worker is a very diligent cat. Currently, SoCCat is planning to build the tallest tower in all of cat history! To build the tallest tower, SoCCat needs a lot of cat dollars. SoCCat plans to make money by taking on construction jobs optimally. There are n companies that periodically offer construction jobs every T cat days. Company i offers a construction job at the beginning of day x_ i + k cdot T (for all integers k geq 0), and it will take SoCCat l_ i cat days to complete the job. Note that SoCCat can only take on one job at a time, and it might take SoCCat longer than T cat days to complete the job. The construction sector is very competitive, so SoCCat can only take on a job on the day it is offered (otherwise, another cat will take the job). SoCCat will begin working on it immediately, so if they took a job on day t, they will complete the job at the end of day t + l_ i - 1. After they completed the job, SoCCat will receive p_ i million cat dollars. SoCCat can take another job starting from day t + l_ i. Currently, it is day 0. SoCCat wonders q possible scenarios: what is the maximum amount of cat dollars SoCCat could get before day z_ j? Input The first line of input contains two integers T and n, denoting the number of cat days between each construction job offered by a company and the number of construction companies (1 leq T leq 20, 000; 1 leq n leq 100, 000). The next n lines each contain three integers x_ i, l_ i, and p_ i, denoting the day (modulo T) the i-th company offers a construction job, the number of cat days SoCCat needs to complete the job, and the number of cat dollars (in millions) SoCCat will receive after completing the job (0 leq x_ i < T; 1 leq l_ i leq 10^{11}; 1 leq p_ i leq 5). The next line contains an integer q, denoting the number of scenarios (1 leq q leq 20, 000). The next q lines each contain an integer z_ j, denoting the day SoCCat wonders in scenario j (1 leq z_ j leq 10^{11}). Output Output q lines. The j-th line should contain the maximum amount of cat dollars (in millions) SoCCat could get before day z_ j. Notes In the sample test case, the 1-st company offers construction jobs at the start of day 0, 10, 20, ldots ; if taken, the job will finish by the end of day 4, 14, 24, ldots  respectively. The 2-nd company offers construction jobs at the start of day 3, 13, 23, ldots ; if taken, the job will finish by the end of day 18, 28, 38, ldots  respectively. In the first and second scenarios, it’s possible to take the 1-st company’s construction job once to get 1 million cat dollars, but it’s not possible to take any other one. In the third scenario, it’s possible to take the 1-st company’s construction jobs twice to get 2 million cat dollars.
