Source: WikiMedia As Jacques-Édouard really likes birthday cakes, he celebrates his birthday every hour, instead of every year. His friends ordered him a round cake from a famous pastry shop, and placed candles on its top surface. The number of candles equals the age of Jacques-Édouard in hours. As a result, there is a huge amount of candles burning on the top of the cake. Jacques-Édouard wants to blow all the candles out in one single breath. You can think of the flames of the candles as being points in the same plane, all within a disk of radius R (in nanometers) centered at the origin. On that same plane, the air blown by Jacques-Édouard follows a trajectory that can be described by a straight strip of width W, which comprises the area between two parallel lines at distance W, the lines themselves being included in that area. What is the minimum width W such that Jacques-Édouard can blow all the candles out if he chooses the best orientation to blow? Input The first line consists of the integers N and R, separated with a space, where N is Jacques-Édouard’s age in hours. Then N lines follow, each of them consisting of the two integer coordinates x_ i and y_ i of the ith candle in nanometers, separated with a space. Limits 3 leq N leq 2cdot 10^{5}; 10 leq R leq 2cdot 10^{8}; for 1leq ileq N, x^2_ i + y^2_ i leq R^{2}; all points have distinct coordinates. Output Print the value W as a floating point number. An additive or multiplicative error of 10^{-5} is tolerated: if y is the answer, any number either within [y-10^{-5}; y+10^{-5}] or within [(1-10^{-5})y; (1+10^{-5})y] is accepted.
