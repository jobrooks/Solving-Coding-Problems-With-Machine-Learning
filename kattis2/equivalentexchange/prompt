It is impossible to create something out of nothing. In order to obtain something, something of equal value must be given. Two brothers, who seek to increase their understanding of alchemy, were left stranded on a deserted island by their mentor. With no other way to survive, they try to use their abilities to gather resources. They’ve documented their stay over d days, tracking how many of each item they have. They’ve given each item an integer ID, ranging from 1 to 10^9. On the ith day, one of two things happen: The younger brother finds one of item f_ i. The older brother transmutes all their stock of item s_ i to item d_ i. As they depart the island, they wish to look back on what they’ve learned so far. To do so, they take inventory of the items they’ve gathered one last time. Can you do the same? Input The first line of input contains one integer 1 leq d leq 5 cdot 10^5, the number of days. The next d lines each contain a query. Each of these lines contains a series of space-separated integers. The first integer is t_ i in { 1, 2} , the type of query. If t_ i = 1, the next integer is f_ i. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one query of this type. If t_ i = 2, the next two integers are s_ i and d_ i. Output Let the days where some item was found be x_1, x_2, dots , x_ n. Print n lines. On the ith line, print the final item ID of the item found on day x_ i.
