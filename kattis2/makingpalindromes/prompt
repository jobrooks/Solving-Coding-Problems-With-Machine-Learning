An alphabetical string is a string consisting of 0 or more capital letters (i.e. [‘A’..‘Z’]). Given an alphabetical string S[1..N], determine the number of palindromic alphabetical strings of length 2N that contains S as a subsequence (not necessarily contiguous). A string is palindromic if it is equal to its reverse. Input The first line of input is an integer representing N, constrained to 0 leq N leq 200. The second line of input is an alphabetical string S of length N. Output Output the number of palindromic alphabetical strings of length 2N containing S as a subsequence. As this could be rather large, output it modulo 10^9+7. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 AA 51 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 2 AB 2
