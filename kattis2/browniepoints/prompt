Stan and Ollie play the game of Odd Brownie Points. Some brownie points are located in the plane, at integer coordinates. Stan plays first and places a vertical line in the plane. The line must go through a brownie point and may cross many (with the same x-coordinate). Then Ollie places a horizontal line that must cross a brownie point already crossed by the vertical line. Those lines divide the plane into four quadrants. The quadrant containing points with arbitrarily large positive coordinates is the top-right quadrant. The players score according to the number of brownie points in the quadrants. If a brownie point is crossed by a line, it does not count. Stan gets a point for each (uncrossed) brownie point in the top-right and bottom-left quadrants. Ollie gets a point for each (uncrossed) brownie point in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants. Your task is to compute the scores of Stan and Ollie given the point through which they draw their lines. Input Input contains a number of test cases, at most 15. The data of each test case appear on a sequence of input lines. The first line of each test case contains a positive odd integer 1 le n le 20, 000 which is the number of brownie points. Each of the following n lines contains two integers, the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) coordinates of a brownie point. All coordinates are at most 10^6 in absolute value. No two brownie points occupy the same place. The input ends with a line containing 0 (instead of the n of a test). Output For each test case of input, print a line with two numbers separated by a single space. The first number is Stanâ€™s score, the second is the score of Ollie when their lines cross the point whose coordinates are given at the center of the input sequence of points for this case.
