All the positive divisors of two integers A and B were written down together in a list. The numbers on the list were then shuffled around. Can you determine what A and B were, based on the list? Input The first line contains an integer N (1 le N le 210,000), the number of divisors on the list. The next line contains the list of divisors, separated by spaces. All divisors are between 1 and 10^{18}. Output Output the two integers A and B â€“ the smaller one first. If there are multiple possible A and B, you may output any ones. Explanation of samples The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4 and 8. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 10 8 1 2 12 1 2 6 4 3 4 8 12
