As a waiter, your favourite question from an indecisive punter is “I’m not sure, what would you recommend?” — so much so, in fact, that you decided to automate away the answer to avoid having to spend any brain cycles on this question ever again. You have the list of all set menus for today and you are going to simply pick one at random. As long as your recommendation corresponds to a list of items on a set menu, everything will be fine. Input One line containing a single integer 1leq nleq 100, the number of set menus. n lines, one for each menu. Each of these lines contains a single integer 1leq dleq 42, followed by a list of d dishes that the meal consists of. Each dish is described using at most 20 lowercase Latin characters. Output Output one line containing m, the number of dishes that you recommend, followed by m lines containing the dishes you recommend. If there are multiple possible solutions, you may output any one of them.
