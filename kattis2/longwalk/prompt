To ignore his impending doom, Jimmy-Jimmy likes to imagine going for long walks. Today, he is imagining a walk on a graph G. G has 2^ n nodes, labelled 0,1,2,dots ,2^ n-1. For each iin { 1,2,dots ,2^ n-1} , G has a bidirectional edge between node i and node 2imod{2^ n}. Jimmy-Jimmy wants to visit m nodes of G in a specific order. He starts his walk at node a_1. From there, he takes the shortest path along the edges of G to a_2, then takes the shortest path from a_2 to a_3, and so on, until he reaches node a_ m, where his walk concludes. Can you determine the total number of edges that Jimmy-Jimmy will imagine walking across? Input Input begins with two space-separated integers 1le nle 62 and 2le mle 10^6. The next line contains m space-separated integers a_1,a_2,dots ,a_ m, where 0le a_ ile 2^ n-1 for all i. Output Output the total number of edges crossed in the walk.
