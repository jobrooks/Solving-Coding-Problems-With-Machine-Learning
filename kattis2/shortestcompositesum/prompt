Given a positive integer N, find a shortest sequence of composite numbers of length at least 2 that sums to N. Input The first line contains an integer N (2 le N le 10^{18}). It is guaranteed that N can be written as the sum of at least 2 composite numbers. Output First, output an integer containing the number of terms in your sum. Then, output a line containing the terms, separated by a single space. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 8 2 4 4
