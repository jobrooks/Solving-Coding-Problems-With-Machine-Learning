A tennis match involves three people: two players and an umpire. Each of these has to come from a different country. There are N countries, and the ith country has a_ i tennis players and b_ i umpires. (Nobody can be both a player and an umpire.) How many different tennis matches are possible? Two tennis matches are different if the sets of involved people are different. Input The first line contains an integer N, where 3 leq N leq 10^5. The following N lines each contain two integers a_ i and b_ i with 0 leq a_ i, b_ i leq 10^6. You can assume sum _{i=1}^ N a_ i leq 10^6 and sum _{i=1}^ N b_ i leq 10^6. Output A single integer, the number of possible different tennis matches. Explanation of Sample 1 Assume the players from the first country are called A_1 and A_2, the players from the second country are called B_1 and B_2, and the umpire from the third country is called C. Then there are 4 matches where C is the umpire: { A_1, B_1, C} , { A_1, B_2, C} , { A_2, B_1, C} , and { A_2, B_2, C} . Similarly, there are 8 matches with the other umpires. In total, there are 12 possible different matches. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 2 1 2 1 2 1 12 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 5 0 5 0 0 5 125
