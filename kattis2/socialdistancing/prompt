You are given a array of n numbers a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ n. We are trying to safe distance n people by arranging them in a row. The government has added strange safe distancing rules: when person i and j are adjacent, they should stand a_{max(i,j)} distance apart. Note that there are no restrictions between non-adjacent persons. Find the minimum distance between the leftmost and rightmost person. Input The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2leq nleq 300, 000) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,ldots ,a_ n (1leq a_ ileq 10^9) — the array given in the problem. Output Output a single integer — the answer to the problem. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 1 3 5 8 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 5 3 1 2
