You are given a simple graph with N nodes and M edges. The graph has the special property that any connected component of size s contains no more than s + 2 edges. You are also given two integers k and P. Find the number of k-colourings of the graph, modulo P. Recall that a simple graph is an undirected graph with no self loops and no repeated edges. A k-colouring of a graph is a way to assign to each node of the graph exactly one of k colours, such that if edge (u, v) is present in the graph, then u and v receive different colors. Input The first line of input consists of four integers, N, M, k, and P (1 leq N leq 50, 000, 0 leq M leq 1.5 N, 1 leq k leq 10^9, 1 leq P leq 2 cdot 10^9). The next M lines of input each contains a pair of integers A and B (1 leq A leq N, 1 leq B leq N), describing an edge in the graph connecting nodes A and B. Output Output the number of k-colourings of the given graph, modulo P. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 3 2 10000 1 2 2 3 3 1 0 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 3 4 13 1 2 2 3 3 1 11
