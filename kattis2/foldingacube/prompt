It is well known that a set of six unit squares that are attached together in a “cross” can be folded into a cube. But what about other initial shapes? That is, given six unit squares that are attached together along some of their sides, can we form a unit cube by folding this arrangement? Input Input consists of 6 lines each containing 6 characters, describing the initial arrangement of unit squares. Each character is either a ., meaning it is empty, or a # meaning it is a unit square. There are precisely 6 occurrences of # indicating the unit squares. These form a connected component, meaning it is possible to reach any # from any other # without touching a . by making only horizontal and vertical movements. Furthermore, there is no 2 times 2 subsquare consisting of only #. That is, the pattern ## ## does not appear in the input. Output If you can fold the unit squares into a cube, display can fold. Otherwise display cannot fold. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 ...... ...... ###### ...... ...... ...... cannot fold Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 ...... #..... ####.. #..... ...... ...... can fold Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 ..##.. ...#.. ..##.. ...#.. ...... ...... cannot fold Sample Input 4 Sample Output 4 ...... ...#.. ...#.. ..###. ..#... ...... can fold
