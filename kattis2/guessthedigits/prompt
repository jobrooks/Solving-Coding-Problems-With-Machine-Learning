Filip came across an interesting math problem: He was supposed to find a five-digit number with the following property. If you cross out its first two digits, then place the digit 8 after the remaining three digits to form a four-digit number and multiply the resulting four-digit number by 4, you will get the original five-digit number. After thinking for a while, he found his answer. But now he is wondering, what if he had to find an m-digit number, where you have to cross out the first n digits, place a (possibly multi-digit) number p after the remaining (m-n)-digit number, then multiply this new number by a number q to get the original number? Please help him! (You may assume that m, p, and q start with a non-zero digit, and n is either 0 or starts with a non-zero digit. The (m-n)-digit number also needs to start with a non-zero digit.) Input The input consists of a single line containing four numbers: m, n, p, and q. You may assume that each number is positive and not larger than 1, 000, 000. You may also assume that mgeq n. Output The output consists of a single line. If such an m-digit number exists, the line contains the smallest such number. If no such number exists, the line contains the string IMPOSSIBLE. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 2 8 4 20512 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 2 1 11 4 IMPOSSIBLE
