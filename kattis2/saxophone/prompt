Do you like saxophone? I have an Eb Alto Saxophone, shown to the right. My fingers move a lot when playing some music, and I’m quite interested in how many times each finger presses a button. Assume that the music is composed of only 14 different notes. They are: C D E F G A B in one octave and C D E F G A B in a higher octave. We use c,d,e,f,g,a,b,C,D,E,F,G,A,B to represent them. The fingers I use for each note are: c: finger 2-4, 7-10 d: finger 2-4, 7-9 e: finger 2-4, 7, 8 f: finger 2-4, 7 g: finger 2-4 a: finger 2, 3 b: finger 2 C: finger 3 D: finger 1-4, 7-9 E: finger 1-4, 7, 8 F: finger 1-4, 7 G: finger 1-4 A: finger 1-3 B: finger 1-2 (Note that every finger is controlling a specific button, different fingers are controlling different buttons.) Write a program to help count the number of times each finger presses the button. A finger presses a button if it is needed in a note, but not used in the last note. Also, if it is the first note, every finger required presses a button. Input The first line of the input is a single integer t (1 le t le 1000), indicating the number of test cases. For each case, there is only one line containing the song. The only allowed characters are “cdefgabCDEFGAB”. There are at most 200 notes in a song, and the song maybe empty. Output For each test case, print 10 numbers indicating the number of presses for each finger. Numbers are separated by a single space.
