Given a sequence A of n numbers, define f(lo,hi), 1 le lo le hi le n, as the Greatest Common Divisor of all the numbers A_{lo} through A_{hi}, inclusive. Note that lo and hi are indices, not members of the list. Given an array, considering all possible values of lo and hi, how many unique values of f(lo,hi) will there be? Input There will be a single test case in the input. This test case will begin with a line with a single integer n (1 le n le 100, 000) representing the length of the sequence. The next n lines will each have an integer a (1 le a le 100). These are the numbers in the sequence, in sequence order. Output Output a single integer denoting the number of unique values f(lo,hi) can have for the input sequence. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 4 6 3 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 3 6 8 5
