Consider a positive integer n. Let f(n) be the number of positive integer divisors of n. For example, if n=8 then f(n)=4, since the divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4 and 8. Now, consider a positive integer x. What is the smallest value of n such that n^{f(n)}=x? Input The single line of input contains a single integer x (1 le x le 10^{18}). This is the x of the statement above. Output Output a single integer, which is the smallest value of n such that n^{f(n)}=x, or -1 if no such value of n exists.
