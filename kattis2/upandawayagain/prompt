Steve’s Retreat Another year has passed, and Steve wants to travel to his vacation house again! There are still n bases located on mountains located around his house. Steve is located at mountain 1 and his vacation house is at mountain x. This year, the Biomes Ski Corporation has built many ski lifts between mountains. Steve wants to take the ski lifts hoping that he can get a more scenic trip than flying. Steve knows that each mountain has a danger level of d_ i, meaning that a mountain with a height of h_ i is only connected via ski lift with a mountain of height h_ j if abs(h_ i - h_ j) leq d_ j. However, due to low budget, only ski lifts going downwards were built. Thus, from a mountain with height h_ i, he can only travel to mountains with a danger level of d_ j and height of h_ j if 0 leq h_ i - h_ j leq d_ j. Each ski lift operates with a time of t between two mountains. Please help Steve figure out the minimum time needed to travel to his vacation house, or determine that he can’t reach his house using ski lifts! Input The first line contains 3 space-separated integers n, x, and t (1 leq n leq 10^5, 1 leq x leq n, 1 leq t leq 10^9), the number of bases, location of the vacation house, and time for each ski lift, respectively. The second line contains n integers h_1, h_2, ldots , h_ n, where h_ i (1 leq h_ i leq 10^5) is the height of the i^{th} base’s mountain. The third line contains n integers d_1, d_2, ldots , d_ n, where d_ i (1 leq d_ i leq 10^5) is the danger level of the i^{th} base’s mountain. Output Output a single integer that is the minimum time Steve needs to travel to his vacation house. Output -1 if he cannot reach his vacation house using ski lifts.
