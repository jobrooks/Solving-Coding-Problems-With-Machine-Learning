As a third-year student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry must study arithmetic (known as Arithmancy in the wizard world). Todayâ€™s Arithmancy lesson revolves around addition. For homework, Harry is given four positive integers n, x, y, and z. Harry needs to find a triplet of integers a, b, and c satisfying all the following conditions: a + b + c = n, x is a substring of a, y is a substring of b, z is a substring of c. For example, given n = 517, x = 33, y = 34, z = 35, the triplet a = 33, b = 134, c = 350 satisfies the above conditions because: 33 + 134 + 350 = 517, 33 is a substring of 33, 34 is a substring of 134, 35 is a substring of 350. If n = 517, x = 33, y = 14, z = 35, the triplet a = 33, b = 134, c = 350 does not satisfy the above conditions because 14 is not a substring of any 134. As there can be multiple triplets satisfying the given conditions, Harry needs to find a triplet with smallest difference between the minimum number and the maximum number. Harry is too lazy for this homework. Please help him! Note: A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. Input The input contains a single line with 4 positive integers: n, x, y and z. All these numbers do not exceed 10^{15}. Output Print a single line containing the smallest difference between the minimum and the maximum number of a triplet satisfying all the above conditions. If there are no triplets satisfying the given conditions, print -1 instead. Explanation of the sample input The triplets satisfying the given conditions are: 517 = 33 + 134 + 350, 517 = 33 + 349 + 135, 517 = 133 + 34 + 350, 517 = 133 + 349 + 35. Among them, the triplets 133, 349, 35 has smallest difference (314) between the maximum value (349) and the minimum value (35). Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 517 33 34 35 314
