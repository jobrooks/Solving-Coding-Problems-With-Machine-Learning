The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest has been held in Vietnam for more than 10 years. The contest is a great chance for the students to meet new friends, broaden their knowledge and of course, win prizes. Every years, universities can send one or multiple teams to the contest and all universities hope to win prizes. The organizers want to define a rule to award the excellent contestants. The contest director decided to follow the World Finals policy by having 4 first prizes, 4 second prizes and 4 third prizes. 12 winners out of more than a hundred teams is also a good proportion to recognize the best students. Since universities can send multiple teams, we donâ€™t want one university to swept all the awards. Thus, only the top team from a university can be awarded. It seems harsh for the second best team from one university but do not worry, they will still receive relevant certificates. The table below is the result of top 10 of Nha Trang Regional Contest 2016. The 4-th (team WINDOWS) and 8-th place (team UBUNTU) did not receive prizes because they were not the top team from University of Engineering and Technology - VNU. Team Metis and team BK.DeepMind are in the same situation.
