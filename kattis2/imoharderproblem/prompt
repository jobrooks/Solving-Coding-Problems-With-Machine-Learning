After passing the final round of the Hunter Exam, Gon is now a Hunter! But before continuing his exciting journey, Gon decides to visit his home in ‘While Island’. Aunt Mito is happy that Gon has become a Hunter and has visited home. But at the same time, she feels worried about Gon — the life of a Hunter is challenging. Thus, she will not allow Gon to leave ‘While Island’, unless Gon is able to solve a puzzle prepared by aunt Mito. But what puzzle should Mito give to Gon? Mito opened ‘IMO 2019 Problems’ and found the following problem: The Bank of Bath issues coins with an H on one side and a T on the other. Prof. Tuy has n of these coins arranged in a line from left to right. He repeatedly performs the following operation: if there are exactly k > 0 coins showing H, then he turns over the k-th coin from the left; otherwise, all coins show T and he stops. For example, if n = 3 the process starting with the configuration THT would be: THT rightarrow HHT rightarrow HTT rightarrow TTT, which stops after three operations. Show that, for each initial configuration, Prof. Tuy stops after a finite number of operations. ‘This problem is too easy’ — Mito thought. ‘Gon will be able to solve it in no time’. After some more thinking, Mito changed the above problem to the following harder version: For each initial configuration C, let L(C) be the number of operations before Prof. Tuy stops. Given a sequence S consisting of H, T and ?, representing some initial state, where ? denotes an unknown state. Calculate the average value of L(C) over all possible sequences C represented by S. Even though Gon is smart, he is still unable to solve this question. Please help Gon! Input The input contains a single non-empty line with at most 10^6 characters — the sequence S. Output The output must contain a single number — the average value of L(C), as explained in the statement. Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn’t exceed 10^{-6}. Namely: let’s assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if frac{|a-b|}{max(1,b)} leq 10^{-6}.
