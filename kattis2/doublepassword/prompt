A computer at ICPC headquarters is protected by a four-digit password—in order to log in, you normally need to guess the four digits exactly. However, the programmer who implemented the password check left a backdoor in the computer—there is a second four-digit password. If the programmer enters a four-digit sequence, and for each digit position the digit entered matches at least one of the two passwords in that same position, then that four-digit sequence will log the programmer into the computer. Given the two passwords, count the number of distinct four-digit sequences that can be entered to log into the computer. Input The input consists of exactly two lines. Each of the two lines contains a string s (|s|~ =~ 4, s~ in ~ { texttt{0-9}} ^*). These are the two passwords. Output Output a single integer, which is the number of distinct four-digit sequences that will log the programmer into the system. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1111 1234 8 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 2718 2718 1
