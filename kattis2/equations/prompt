Given 2 linear equations on the variables x and y, solve for x and y. Input The first line of input contains an integer 1 le N le 100, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two equations, each on a separate line. An empty line separates cases. An equation consists of at least 2 and at most 10 terms separated by addition, subtraction, or equality operators. A term is an integer, or a variable name (x or y) optionally preceded by a minus sign or an integer coefficient. There is exactly one equality operator. Constant terms and coefficients are at most 100 in absolute value. All operators are surrounded by spaces, and there are no spaces within terms. Output For each case, print two lines, giving the values of x and y as rationals in simplest terms. If x or y has no unique rational value such that both equations hold, print “don’t know” for its value. Print an empty line between cases.
