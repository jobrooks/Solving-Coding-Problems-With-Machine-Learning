Input The first line of input contains an integer n (n leq 10000) giving the number of test cases. Then follow n lines each containing 8 integers x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2 x_3 y_3 x_4 y_4, indicating a line segment from (x_1, y_1) to (x_2, y_2), and a line segment from (x_3, y_3) to (x_4, y_4). Coordinates have absolute value at most 10000. Output For each test case, output the intersection between the two line segments in the following format: If the intersection is empty (i.e. the segments do not intersect), output the word “none”. If there is a unique intersection point (X, Y), output the numbers X and Y separated by a single space. If the intersection is itself a line segment between two points (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2), output the numbers X_1 Y_1 X_2 Y_2 separated by spaces, in that order. Pick the point with smallest x-coordinate as the first point, or the point with smallest y-coordinate if both have the same x-coordinate. Numbers should be given with 2 decimals of precision.
