Given a triangle ABC with incenter (center of its inscribed circle) I, and circumscribed circle O, let M, N and P be the second points of intersection of the lines through A and I, B and I resp. C and I with the circle O. Let E and F be the intersections of the line NP with AB and AC respectively. Similarly, let G and H be the intersections of the line MN with AC and BC respectively and let J and K be the intersections of the line MP with BC and AB respectively. Write a program which takes as input the coordinates of the vertices A, B and C of the triangle and outputs the lengths of the segments EF, FG, GH, HJ, JK and KE. Supposedly,\[ |EF| + |GH| + |JK| \le |KE| + |FG| + |HJ| \] Input Input consists of a single line containing three real values: the x coordinate of B, B_ x (-20 le B_ x le 20), the x coordinate of C, C_ x (-20 le C_ x le 20) and the y coordinate of C, C_ y (-20 le C_ y le 20). The floating point values are given with up to 4 digits after the decimal point. A will always be the origin (0,0) and B will always be on the x-axis so B_ y = 0. Output Output 6 decimal values separated by spaces, which are the lengths of EF, FG, GH, HJ, JK and KE in that order. Your answers will be considered correct if their absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-6}.
