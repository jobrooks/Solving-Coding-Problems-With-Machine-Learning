Enchanted Pickaxes Steve enjoys parties and word games. At one party, he challenges his friends to play a new word game that he invented. In Steve’s game, there are four words: “Efficiency”, “Unbreaking”, “Silk”, and “Touch”. There are P players playing the game. At a given N^{th} round, the players go around in circles, each saying the word “Efficiency” once per person, until the word has been said N times. Then, starting with the next player (right after the last player to say “Efficiency”), they go around in the same fashion, each saying “Unbreaking” until it has been said N times. Lastly, continuing with the next player, they go around saying “Silk” and “Touch” alternately until both words have been said N times. For instance, in a game of 3 people, the sequence of words is as follows: 1^{st} Player 2^{nd} Player 3^{rd} Player Efficiency Unbreaking Silk (back to the 1^{st} player) Touch Efficiency Efficiency Unbreaking Unbreaking Silk Touch Silk Touch Efficiency Efficiency Efficiency Unbreaking Unbreaking Unbreaking Silk Touch Silk Touch Silk Touch (end of 3^{rd} round) Here, one can see that it takes 24 turns (number of words said) to complete three rounds of the game. Moreover, Player 3 goes last during the third round. Steve checks in at the M^{th} turn, telling his friends to wrap up the game and go for a walk in the soul sand valley. Which word is being said at the M^{th} turn, and who will go last in this round? Input The first line contains one integer P (1 leq P leq 1, 000), the number of players in the game. The second line contains one integer M (1 leq M leq 10^6), which refers to the M^{th} word that is said during the game. Output The output should consist of two lines. On the first line, output the M^{th} word said during the game; it should be one of “Efficiency”, “Unbreaking”, “Silk”, or “Touch”. On the second line, output an integer representing the player who goes last during this round (players are numbered 1, 2, 3, ldots ).
