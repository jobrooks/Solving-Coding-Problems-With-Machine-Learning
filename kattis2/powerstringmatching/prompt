For two strings s_1 and s_2, let s_1 + s_2 denote their concatenation, e.g. abc + cda is the string abccda. Now for a string s and an integer k geq 0 we let s^ k denote the result of concatenating k copies of s, i.e. texttt{ab}^3 = texttt{ababab}. If k = 0, then s^ k is just the empty string. Finally, a collection of nonempty strings s_1, ldots , s_ k is said to partition a string s if s = s_1 + s_2 + ldots + s_ k. For this problem, you will be given two strings s, t. The goal is to determine if there is a partition s_1, s_2, ldots , s_ k of s and integers a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ k geq 0 such that t = s_1^{a_1} + s_2^{a_2} + ldots + s_ k^{a_ k}. Input The first line of input contains two integers N (1 leq N leq 300) and M (1 leq M leq 300). The second line contains a string s of length N and the third line contains a string t of length M. Both strings contain only the characters 0 and 1. Output Output yes if it there is a partition s_1, s_2, ldots , s_ k of s and integers a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ k geq 0 such that t = s_1^{a_1} + s_2^{a_2} + ldots + s_ k^{a_ k}, otherwise output no.
