Map websites such as Bing Maps and Google Maps often store their maps as many different image files, called tiles. The lowest zoom level (level 0) consists of a single tile with a low-detail image of the whole map, zoom level 1 consists of four tiles each containing a slightly more detailed version of a quarter of the map, and in general zoom level n contains 4^ n different tiles that each contain a part of the map. One way of identifying a tile is by means of a quadkey. A quadkey is a string of digits uniquely identifying a tile at a certain zoom level. The first digit specifies in which of the four quadrants of the whole map the tile lies: 0 for the top-left quadrant, 1 for the top-right quadrant, 2 for the bottom-left quadrant and 3 for the bottom-right quadrant. The subsequent digits specify in which sub quadrant of the current quadrant the tile is. The quadkeys for zoom levels 1 to 3 are shown in Figure 1(a). (a) Quadkeys for zoom levels 1 to 3 (b) Coordinates for zoom level 3 Figure 1: Visualisation of the two representations. The images are taken from the MSDN. Another way of identifying a tile is to give the zoom level and x and y coordinates, where (0,0) is the left-top corner. The coordinates for the tiles of zoom level 3 are shown in Figure 1(b). Given the quadkey of a tile, output the zoom level and x and y coordinates of that tile. Input The input consists of: one line with a string s (1leq text {length}(s) leq 30), the quadkey of the map tile. The string s consists of only the digits ‘0’, ‘1’, ‘2’ and ‘3’. Output Output three integers, the zoom level and the x and y coordinates of the tile. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 1 1 1 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 130 3 6 2
