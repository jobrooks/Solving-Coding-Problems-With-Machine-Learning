In this problem, you have to find the last three digits before the decimal point for the number (3 + sqrt {5})^ n. For example, when n = 5, (3 + sqrt {5})^5 = 3935.73982.... The answer is 935. For n = 2, (3 + sqrt {5})^2 = 27.4164079.... The answer is 027. Input The first line of input gives the number of cases, 1 le T le 100. T test cases follow, each on a separate line. Each test case contains one positive integer 2 le n le 2, 000, 000, 000. Output For each input case, you should output: Case #X: Y where X is the number of the test case and Y is the last three integer digits of the number (3 + sqrt {5})^ n. In case that number has fewer than three integer digits, add leading zeros so that your output contains exactly three digits. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 5 2 Case #1: 935 Case #2: 027
