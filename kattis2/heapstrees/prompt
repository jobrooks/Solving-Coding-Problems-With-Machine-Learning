You are given a rooted tree with n nodes. The nodes are labeled 1 to n, and node 1 is the root. Each node has a value v_ i. You would like to turn this tree into a heap. That is, you would like to choose the largest possible subset of nodes that satisfy this Heap Property: For every node pair i,j in the subset, if node i is an ancestor of node j in the tree, then v_ i > v_ j. Note that equality is not allowed. Figure out the maximum number of nodes you can choose to form such a subset. The subset does not have to form a subtree. Input Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input will contain a single integer n (1 le n le 2 cdot 10^5), which is the number of nodes in the tree. The nodes are numbered 1 to n. Each of the next n lines will describe the nodes, in order from i=1 to n. They will each contain two integers v_ i and p_ i, where v_ i (0 le v_ i le 10^9) is the value in the node, and p_ i (0 le p_ i < i) is the index of its parent. Every node’s index will be strictly greater than its parent node’s index. Only node 1, the root, will have p_1=0, since it has no parent. For all other nodes (i=2, 3, ldots , n), 1 le p_ i < i. Output Output a single integer representing the number of nodes in the largest subset satisfying the Heap Property.
