Input Input contains several test cases. Each test case begins with an integer n (2 le n le 100, 000). Then follows a list of n points, one per line, each of the form x y. Coordinates are floating point values with at most 2 decimals and absolute value bounded by 100, 000. The input is terminated by a case beginning with 0. Warning! This problem has quite large input files. Output For each test case, output any closest pair of the input points, on the form x_{1} y_{1} x_{2} y_{2}.
