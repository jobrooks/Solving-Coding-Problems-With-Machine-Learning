Our favorite Onid Pizza would like to have a commercial aired in a radio. Since they are close to KTH, they want to attract mainly students. It’s not a good idea to have the commercial aired between 8 am and 5 pm, because most of the students are in the school and don’t listen to the radio. Onid made a survey and now they know how many students listen to the radio at each point of the day. They also know that if each student listens to a commercial, he or she will spend one Swedish crown on pizza in expectation. Thus if 100 students listen to a commercial, Onid will increase their income by 100 crowns on average from selling more pizza. Of course, Onid Pizza has to pay a fixed amount every time the commercial is played. The radio has a commercial break every 15 minutes. Unfortunately, Onid can choose only one continuous sequence of commercial breaks, for example all breaks from 5 pm to 8 pm. Help them to choose a continuous sequence of commercial breaks such that their profit is maximal. Input The first line of the input contains two space separated positive integers N, P – the total number of commercial breaks in a day and the price of one commercial break. You can assume that N le 100, 000 and P le 1, 000. On the next line there are N space-separated integers – the i’th integer denotes how many students listen to the i-th commercial break. There are always at most 2, 000 students listening. Output Output contains one line with one integer – the biggest expected extra profit Onid can get by selecting a continuous sequence of commercial breaks.
