Input There are several test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing an integer n, where 1 leq n leq 100. Then follow n lines, each containing n floating point numbers. The j:th number on the i:th row gives the entry a_{i,j} of the matrix A. Then follows one line containing n floating point numbers, the i:th of which is the i:th element of the vector b. The input is ended with a case where n = 0. Output For each operation in each test case, output the vector x giving the solution to the system of equations Ax = b. For variables for which there are more than one possible value, output “?”. If the system is inconsistent, output “inconsistent”.
