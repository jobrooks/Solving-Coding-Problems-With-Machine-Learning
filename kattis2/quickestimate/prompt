Photo by Simon A. Eugster Let’s face it... you are not that handy. When you need to make a major home repair, you often need to hire someone to help. When they come for the first visit, they make an estimate of the cost. Here they must be careful: if they overestimate the cost, it might scare you off, but if they underestimate, the work might not be worth their time. Because the worker is so careful, it can take a long time for them to produce the estimate. But that’s frustrating — when you ask for an estimate, you really are asking for the magnitude of the cost. Will this be $10 or $100 or $1, 000? That’s all you really want to know on a first visit. Please help the worker make the type of estimate you desire. Write a program that, given the worker’s estimate, reports just the magnitude of the cost — the number of digits needed to represent the estimate. Input Input begins with a line containing an integer N (1 le N le 100). The next N lines each contain one estimated cost, which is an integer between 0 and 10^{100}. (Some of the workers overcharge quite a bit.) Output For each estimated cost, output the number of digits required to represent it.
