A sequence of integers is said to Zigzag if adjacent elements alternate between strictly increasing and strictly decreasing. Note that the sequence may start by either increasing or decreasing. Given a sequence of integers, determine the length of the longest subsequence that Zigzags. For example, consider this sequence: 1 2 3 4 2 There are several Zigzagging subsequences of length 3: 1 3 2 1 4 2 2 3 2 2 4 2 3 4 2 But there are none of length greater than 3, so the answer is 3. Input Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input contains an integer n (1 le n le 1, 000, 000) which is the number of integers in the list. Each of the following n lines will have an integer k (1 le k le 1, 000, 000). Output Output a single integer, which is the length of the longest Zigzagging subsequence of the input list. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 1 2 3 4 2 3 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
