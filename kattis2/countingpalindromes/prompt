A palindrome number is a non-negative number without leading zeroes, that reads the same forward or backward. For example, 12321, 44 and 9 are palindrome numbers, while 010, 123 and 100 are not. Given a positive integer n, a prime number p and a non-negative integer k less than p. A palindrome number x is called a good palindrome, iff x is equal to k modulo p. In other words, the remainder when x is divided by p equals k. Please count the number of good palindromes with exactly n digits. As this number can be very large, please calculate the result modulo 10^9 + 7. Input The input contains 3 integers n, p and k (1 le n le 10^{18}, 2 le p le 1, 000, 0 le k < p). It is guaranteed that p is a prime. Output Output a single integer â€” the number of good palindromes with exactly n digits, modulo 10^9 + 7. Explanation of Sample input The good palindromes are 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 2 0 5
