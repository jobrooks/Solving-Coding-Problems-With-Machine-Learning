A Derangement is a permutation p of {1, 2, ldots , n} where p_ i ne i for all i from 1 to n. A rotation of a sequence a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ n with offset k (1 le k le n) is equal to the sequence a_ k, a_{k+1}, ldots , a_ n, a_1, a_2, ldots , a_{k-1}. A sequence of length n has at most n distinct rotations. Given a derangement D, let f(D) denote the number of distinct rotations of D that are also derangements. For example, f([2, 1]) = 1, f([3, 1, 2]) = 2. Given n and a prime number p, count the number of derangements D of {1, 2, ldots , n} such that f(D) = n-2, modulo p. Input The single line of input contains two integers n (3 le n le 10^6) and p (10^8 le p le 10^9+7), where n is a permutation size, and p is a prime number. Output Output a single integer, which is the number of derangements D of size n with f(D) = n-2, modulo p. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 1000000007 0 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 6 999999937 20
