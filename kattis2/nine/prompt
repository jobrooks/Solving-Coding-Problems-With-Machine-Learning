How many positive d digit numbers exist that do not contain a nine? Input The first line of the input consists of a single integer, T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T cases consists of a single integer d, the number of digits. 1 leq T leq 20 1 leq d leq 10^{18} Output For each test case, output the number of positive numbers with d digits that do not contain a nine. Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 1, 000, 000, 007. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 1 2 100 8 72 343393926
