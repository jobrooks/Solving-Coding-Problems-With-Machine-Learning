Given n, a positive integer, how many positive integers less than n are relatively prime to n? Two integers a and b are relatively prime if there are no integers x ge 2, y ge 1, z ge 1 such that a = xy and b = xz. Input There up to 10 test cases. For each test case, standard input contains a line with 1leq n leq 1, 000, 000, 000. A line containing 0 follows the last case. Output For each test case there should be single line of output answering the question posed above. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 7 12 0 6 4
