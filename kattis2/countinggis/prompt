Given a permutation A = (a_1, a_2, dots , a_ N) of the integers 1, 2, dots , N, we define the greedily increasing subsequence (GIS) in the following way. Let g_1 = a_1. For every i > 1, let g_ i be the leftmost integer in A that is strictly larger than g_{i-1}. If for a given i there is no such integer, we say that the GIS of the sequence is the sequence (g_1, g_2, ..., g_{i - 1}). For example, consider the permutation (2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 7, 6). First, we have g_1 = 2. The leftmost integer larger than 2 is 3, so g_2 = 3. The leftmost integer larger than 3 is 5 (1 is too small), so g_3 = 5. Finally, g_4 = 7. Thus, the GIS of (2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 7, 6) is (2, 3, 5, 7). Given a sequence G = (g_1, g_2, dots , g_ L), how many permutations A of the integers 1, 2, dots , N have G as its GIS? Input The first line of input contains the integers 1 le N le 10^6, the number of elements of the permutation A, and 1 le L le 10^6, the length of the sequence G. The next line contains L positive integers between 1 and N, the elements g_1, dots , g_ L of the sequence G. Output Output a single integer: the number of N-element permutations having the given sequence as its GIS. Since this number may be large, output it modulo the prime number 10^9 + 7.
