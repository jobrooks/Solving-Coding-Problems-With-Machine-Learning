An infinite full binary tree labeled by positive rational numbers is defined by: The label of the root is 1/1. The left child of label p/q is p/(p+q). The right child of label p/q is (p+q)/q. The top of the tree is shown in the following figure: A rational sequence is defined by doing a level order (breadth first) traversal of the tree (indicated by the light dashed line). So that:\[ F(1) = 1/1, F(2) = 1/2, F(3) = 2/1, F(4) = 1/3, F(5) = 3/2, F(6) = 2/3, \ldots \] Write a program which takes as input a rational number, p/q, in lowest terms and finds the next rational number in the sequence. That is, if F(n) = p/q, then the result is F(n+1). Input The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 le P le 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed identically and independently. Each data set consists of a single line of input. It contains the data set number, K, which is then followed by a space, then the numerator of the fraction, p, followed immediately by a forward slash (/), followed immediately by the denominator of the fraction, q. Both p and q will be relatively prime and 0 le p, q le 2, 147, 483, 647. Output For each data set there is a single line of output. It contains the data set number, K, followed by a single space which is then followed by the numerator of the fraction, followed immediately by a forward slash (/) followed immediately by the denominator of the fraction. Inputs will be chosen such that neither the numerator nor the denominator will overflow a 32-bit integer.
