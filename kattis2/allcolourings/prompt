Given an undirected graph G = (V,E), a proper colouring of G with K colours is an assignment of values from 1 through K to each vertex so that each edge receives a different value/colour. That is, a proper K-colouring is a mapping sigma : V rightarrow { 1, 2, ldots , K}  such that sigma (u) neq sigma (v) for each edge (u,v) of E. So much effort has been spent finding proper colourings of graphs that the improper colourings are left out. Thatâ€™s a shame, because all colourings are beautiful! You want to examine every possible colouring to see how many edges receive the same colour at its endpoints. That is, for each value b from 0 to |E| you should compute the number of K-colourings sigma : V rightarrow { 1, 2, ldots , K}  such that the number of edges (u,v) of G receiving the same colour on both endpoints (i.e. sigma (u) = sigma (v)) is exactly equal to b. Since this number can be large for the given input bounds, you should instead report what this value would be if it was reduced modulo 1, 000, 000, 009. Note we are calling any mapping sigma : V rightarrow { 1, 2, ldots , K}  a K-colouring whether it is proper or not. The first sample input is illustrated below. All colourings of the graph with K = 2 colours are shown and are arranged according to the number of edges whose endpoints receive the same colour. Input The first line of input contains three integers N (1 leq N leq 20), M (0 leq M leq 20), and K (1 leq K leq 10^9). Here, N is the number of nodes in the graph, M is the number of edges in the graph, and K is the number of colours we will use in our K-colouring. Then M lines follow, each containing a pair of integers u,v (1 leq u,v leq N, u neq v) indicating u and v are connected by an undirected edge. No edge will appear more than once in the input. Output Output a single line with |E|+1 values c_0, c_1, ldots , c_{|V|} in that order with a single space separating consecutive values. Here, c_ b is the number of K-colourings of G that have exactly b monochromatic edges, reduced modulo 1, 000, 000, 009.
