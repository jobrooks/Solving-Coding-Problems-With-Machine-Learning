Given a N times N grid of integers, we can choose a combination of N numbers where no two in the same row and no two in the same column. We aim to find a combination of N numbers whose minimum is maximized. Input The first line of input consists of an integer N, where 1 leq N leq 30. The next N lines each contains N integers, representing the grid. Each integer is in the range [1..10^6]. Output Output a single integer, representing the maximum possible value of the minimum. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 3 1 4 1 5 1 2 9 1 2 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 5 17 24 1 8 15 23 5 7 14 16 4 6 13 20 22 10 12 19 21 3 11 18 25 2 9 21
