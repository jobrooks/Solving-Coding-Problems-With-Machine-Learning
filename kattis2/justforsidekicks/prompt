The poniesâ€™ pets are playing with some gems they found. There are six types of gems, with values V_1, V_2, dots , V_6, respectively. They have laid out N gems in a row. The i^text {th} of these gems is of type P_ i. Now, with nothing better to do and no better way to hide a queries on an array problem, they make Q queries on the gems. In the i^text {th} query, either: they replace the K_ i^text {th} gem with a gem of type P_ i, they revalue the P_ i^text {th} type of gem as having value V_ i, or they want to know the total value of the gems from the L_ i^text {th} one to the R_ i^text {th} one, inclusive. Please help them answer the queries! Input The first line of input contains two integers, N (1 leq N leq 200, 000) and Q (1 leq Q leq 200, 000), the number of gems, and the number of queries, respectively. The second line of input contains six integers, V_1, V_2, dots , V_6 (1 leq V_ i leq 10^9), the values of the types of gems. The third line of input contains a string of N characters. In particular, the i^text {th} of these characters contains P_ i (1 leq P_ i leq 6), the type of the i^text {th} gem. The next Q lines contain the queries. In particular, the i^text {th} of these lines begins with a single integer: If this integer is 1, two integers K_ i (1 leq K_ i leq N) and P_ i (1 leq P_ i leq 6) follow, indicating that they replace the K_ i^text {th} gem with a gem of type P_ i. It is guaranteed that P_ i is different from the type of the K_ i^text {th} gem. If this integer is 2, two integers P_ i (1 leq P_ i leq 6) and V_ i (1 leq V_ i leq 10^9) follow, indicating that they revalue the P_ i^text {th} type of gem as having value V_ i. It is guaranteed that V_ i is different from the value of the P_ i^text {th} type of gem. If this integer is 3, two integers L_ i and R_ i (1 leq L_ i leq R_ i leq N) follow, indicating that they want to know the total value of the gems from the L_ i^text {th} one to the R_ i^text {th} one, inclusive. It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of type 3. Output For each query of type 3, output a single integer on a line by itself, the total value of gems from the L_ i^text {th} one to the R_ i^text {th} one, inclusive.
