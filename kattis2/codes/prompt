Error correcting codes are used in a wide variety of applications ranging from satellite communication to music CDs. The idea is to encode a binary string of length k as a binary string of length n>k, called a codeword, in such a way that even if some bit(s) of the encoding are corrupted (if you scratch on your CD for instance), the original k-bit string can still be recovered. There are three important parameters associated with an error correcting code: the length of codewords (n), the dimension (k) which is the length of the unencoded strings, and finally the minimum distance (d) of the code. Distance between two codewords is measured as Hamming distance, i.e., the number of positions in which the codewords differ: 0010 and 0100 are at distance 2. The minimum distance of the code is the distance between the two different codewords that are closest to each other. Linear codes are a simple type of error correcting codes with several nice properties. One of them is that the minimum distance is the smallest distance any non-zero codeword has to the zero codeword (the codeword consisting of n zeros always belongs to a linear code of length n). Another nice property of linear codes of length n and dimension k is that they can be described by an ntimes k generator matrix of zeros and ones. Encoding a k-bit string is done by viewing it as a column vector and multiplying it by the generator matrix. The example below shows a generator matrix and how the string 1001 is encoded.\[ \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) \left(\begin{array}{c} 1\\ 0\\ 0\\ 1\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c} 1\\ 0\\ 0\\ 1 \\ 1\\ 0\\ 0 \end{array}\right) \] Matrix multiplication is done as usual except that addition is done modulo 2 (i.e., 0+1=1+0=1 and 0+0=1+1=0). The set of codewords of this code is then simply all vectors that can be obtained by encoding all k-bit strings in this way. Write a program to calculate the minimum distance for several linear error correcting codes of length at most 30 and dimension at most 15. Each code will be given as a generator matrix. Input You will be given several generator matrices as input. The first line contains an integer 1 le Tleq 40 indicating the number of test cases. The first line of each test case gives the parameters n and k where 2leq nleq 30, 1 leq kleq 15 and n > k, as two integers separated by a single space. The following n lines describe a generator matrix. Each line is a row of the matrix and has k space separated entries that are 0 or 1. You may assume that for any generator matrix in the input, there will never be two different unencoded strings which give the same codeword. Output For each generator matrix output a single line with the minimum distance of the corresponding linear code.
