At 3, 147.3 meters high, Fansipan is the tallest mountain in the Indochina peninsula. To promote tourism, n stations were built on the mountain, numbered from 1 to n. Two companies, Mobi and Vina are in charge of operating cable cars connecting the stations. Each of the two companies have k cable cars. The i-th cable car of Mobi connects two stations MS_ i and ME_ i. The i-th cable car of Vina connects two stations VS_ i and VE_ i. Two stations are called connected by a company, iff we can go from one station to the other by using cable cars only of that company. To achieve peaceful cooperation, the two companies agreed with the following conditions: For every valid i, MS_ i < ME_ i and VS_ i < VE_ i. All MS_ i are unique, all ME_ i are unique. All VS_ i are unique, all VE_ i are unique. For any i ne j, if MS_ i < MS_ j, then ME_ i < ME_ j. For any i ne j, if VS_ i < VS_ j, then VE_ i < VE_ j. No pair of stations is connected by both companies. In other words, for every pair of stations i and j, if i and j are connected by Mobi, they should not be connected by Vina, and vice versa. Given n and k, your task is to check whether it is possible for Mobi and Vina to each operates k cable cars, satisfying all the above conditions. Input The input contains two integers n and k, separated by a single space (1 le k < n le 100). Output For each test case, if it is not possible to satisfy all the conditions, print ‘NO’. Otherwise, print ‘YES’, followed by 2 cdot k lines. In the first k lines, the i-th line contains two integers MS_ i and ME_ i. In the last k lines, the i-th line contains two integers VS_ i and VE_ i. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 1 YES 1 2 1 3 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 2 NO
