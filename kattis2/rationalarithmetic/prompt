Input The first line of input contains one integer, giving the number of operations to perform. Then follow the operations, one per line, each of the form x_1 y_1 mbox{op} x_2 y_2. Here, -10^9 leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 < 10^9 are integers, indicating that the operands are x_1/y_1 and x_2/y_2. The operator op is one of ’+’, ’-’, ’*’, ’/’, indicating which operation to perform. You may assume that y_1 ne 0, y_2 ne 0, and that x_2 ne 0 for division operations. Output For each operation in each test case, output the result of performing the indicated operation, in shortest terms, in the form indicated.
