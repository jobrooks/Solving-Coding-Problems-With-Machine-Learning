Photo by Bob Chao Everyone likes to share things in common with other people. Numbers are the same way! Numbers like it when they have a factor in common. For example, 4 and 6 share a common factor of 2, which gives them something to talk about. For a given integer n, we define a function, f(n), equal to the number of integers in the range left[1, nright] that share a common factor greater than 1 with n. Furthermore, we can define a second function, g(n), which characterizes the fraction of numbers that like a given number as follows: g(n) = frac{f(n)}{n} What we really want to know though, is, for any integer 2 leq k leq n, what is the maximum value of g(k)? Input The input consists of a single integer n (2 leq n leq 10^{18}), the value of n for the input case. Output For the provided test case, output the result as a fraction, in lowest terms, in the form p/q where the greatest common divisor of p and q is 1. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 10 2/3 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 100 11/15
