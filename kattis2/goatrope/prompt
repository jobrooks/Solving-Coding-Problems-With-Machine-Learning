You have a fence post located at the point (x, y) in the plane, to which a goat is tethered by a rope. You also have a house, which you model as an axis-aligned rectangle with diagonally opposite corners at the points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2). You want to pick a length of rope that guarantees the goat cannot reach the house. Determine the minimum distance from the fence post to the house, so that you can make sure to use a shorter rope. Input The input consists of a single line containing six space-separated integers x, y, x_1, y_1, x_2, and y_2, each in the range [-999, 999]. It is guaranteed that x_1 < x_2 and y_1 < y_2, and that (x, y) is strictly outside the axis-aligned rectangle with corners at (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2). Output Print the minimum distance from the goatâ€™s post to the house, with a relative or absolute error no more than 0.001.
