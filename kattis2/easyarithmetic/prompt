Harry is now a third-year student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Contrary to popular belief, arithmetic (known as Arithmancy in the wizard world) is crucial to becoming a powerful wizard. For todayâ€™s Arithmancy homework, Harry is given a super long expression s of length n, containing digits, the + and - operators. The i-th (1 le i le n) character of s is denoted by s_ i. Harry must answer q queries of the following two types: ? ; ell ; r: Compute the value of the expression from the ell -th character to the r-th character, inclusive. As the value of this expression can be very large, Harry must calculate it modulo 998, 244, 353. ! ; i ; c: Change s_ i to the character c. Please help Harry! Input The first line contains n characters representing the expression s (1 le n le 10^5). It is guaranteed that all characters are either digits or the + and - operators, and no two consecutive characters in s are operators. The second line contains q (1 le q le 10^5). In the next q lines, each line contains one query: ? ; ell ; r (1 le ell le r le n): representing a query of the first type. It is guaranteed that s_ r is a digit. ! ; i ; c (1 le i le n), c is either a digit or + or -: representing a query of the second type. It is guaranteed that after this query, no two consecutive characters are operators. Output For each query of the first type, print the value of the expression, modulo 998, 244, 353.
