You are given a simple connected graph where each edge is assigned a non-negative weight. Recall that a minimum spanning tree of a graph is a connected, acyclic subset of the edges of the graph with minimum total weight. Find an edge which maximizes the minimum spanning tree weight of a given graph if that edge is deleted. It is guaranteed that the input graph remains connected after deleting any one edge. Input The first line of input contains two integers n (3 le n le 10^5) and m (3 le m le 10^6), where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in the input graph. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Each of the next m lines contains three integers a, b (1le a<ble n) and w (1le wle 10^6). This denotes an edge between vertices a and b with weight w. Output Output a single integer, which is the minimum spanning tree weight of the input graph after the right edge is deleted.
