A student called Slon is very mischievous in school. He is always bored in class and he is always making a mess. The teacher wanted to calm him down and “tame” him, so he has given him a difficult mathematical problem. The teacher gives Slon an arithmetic expression A, the integer P and M. Slon has to answer the following question: “What is the minimal non-negative value of variable x in expression A so that the remainder of dividing A with M is equal to P?”. The solution will always exist. Additionally, it will hold that, if we apply the laws of distribution on expression A, variable x will not multiply variable x (formally, the expression is a polynomial of the first degree in variable x). Examples of valid expressions: 5 + x cdot (3 + 2), x + 3 cdot x + 4 cdot (5 + 3 cdot (2 + x - 2 cdot x)). Examples of invalid expressions: 5 cdot (3 + x cdot (3 + x)), x cdot (x + x cdot (1 + x)). Input The first line of input contains the expression A (1 leq lvert Arvert leq 100, 000). The second line of input contains two integers P (0 leq P leq M - 1) and M (1 leq M leq 1, 000, 000). The arithmetic expression A will only consists of characters +, -, *, (, ), x and digits from 0 to 9. The brackets will always be paired, the operators +, - and * will always be applied to exactly two values (there will not be an expression (-5) or (4+-5)) and all multiplications will be explicit (there will not be an expression 4(5) or 2(x)). Output The first and only line of output must contain the minimal non-negative value of variable x.
