A string t is a Cyclic Substring of a string s if there is some rotation of s such that t is a substring of that rotation of s. For example, if s is fatcat, then atc and atf are both Cyclic Substrings of s. However, act is not a Cyclic Substring of s. A string s is Internally Reversibly Cyclic if, for every proper substring t of s, the reverse of t is a Cyclic Substring of s. Given a string, determine if it is Internally Reversibly Cyclic. Input The single line of input contains a string s (1 le |s| le 1{,}000, s in { texttt{a}-texttt{z}} ^*) Output Output a single integer, which is 1 if s is Internally Reversibly Cyclic, 0 otherwise.
