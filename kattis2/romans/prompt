The English word “mile” derives from the Latin “mille passus”, meaning “a thousand paces”. A Roman mile was the distance a soldier would walk in 1, 000 paces (a pace being two steps, one with each foot). Over time, the actual distance referred to as a “mile” has changed. The modern English mile is 5, 280 (modern) feet. The Roman mile is believed to have been about 4, 854 (modern) feet. Therefore a distance of x English miles would correspond to 1, 000 cdot frac{5, 280}{4, 854} Roman paces. Write a program to convert distances in English miles into Roman paces. Input Input will consist of a single line containing a single real number 0 le X le 1, 000 denoting a distance in English miles. The number X has at most 3 digits of precision after the decimal point. Output Print an integer denoting the closest number of Roman paces equivalent to X. Your answer should be rounded to the closest integer (with an exact .5 decimal part rounded up). Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1.0 1088 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 20.267 22046
