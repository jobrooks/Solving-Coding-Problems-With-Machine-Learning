After taking the Peak Tram, you reach the Peak Tower — an ideal place to take a picture of the Victoria Harbour. Being a must-see attraction, the Peak Tower is packed with tourists, and it’s pretty hard to take a picture without many people blocking the beautiful scene. Occasionally birds are flying around as well. You are wondering: how to take the best picture to minimise the area blocked by tourists and birds? You are taking a picture to capture a scene of width W and height H (both in metres). The bottem left corner of the scene are at coordinates (0,0). Each tourist or bird can be modelled as an axis-aligned rectangle that moves at a constant velocity. In the above example there are three tourists (red, blue, and orange) and a bird (dark green). You want to minimise the area of the union of these rectangles. Each tourist or bird can be represented by a rectangle of width w and height h (both in metres). Its motion is described by: s_ x: The initial x-coordinate of its bottom left corner (at time t = 0). s_ y: The initial y-coordinate of its bottom left corner (at time t = 0). v_ x: The horizontal velocity in mathrm{m/s} at which it moves (positive if it’s moving rightwards). v_ y: The vertical velocity in mathrm{m/s} at which it moves (positive if it’s moving upwards). Obviously the best picture you can take is to wait until all objects are gone. However, you have a tight schedule and must take the picture within E seconds. Given the information about the motion of the N objects, when should you take the picture to minimise the area blocked by them? Input The first line consists of an integer N (0 leq N leq 50). The second line consists of 3 real numbers W, H, E (0 < W, H leq 300, 0 < E leq 100). Each of the following N lines consists of 6 real numbers w, h, s_ x, s_ y, v_ x, v_ y, representing the size (in metres) and motion (in mathrm{m/s}) of the ith object (0 < w,h leq 100, -300 leq s_ x, s_ y, v_ x, v_ y leq 300). Each real number has at most 6 digits past the decimal point. Output Output a number to indicate the minimal possible total area blocked by tourists and birds. Any solution with an absolute or relative error within 10^{-6} will be accepted.
