Given N integers in the range [-50, 000, 50, 000], how many ways are there to pick three integers a_ i, a_ j, a_ k, such that i, j, k are pairwise distinct and a_ i + a_ j = a_ k? Two ways are different if their ordered triples (i, j, k) of indices are different. Input The first line of input consists of a single integer N (1 leq N leq 200, 000). The next line consists of N space-separated integers a_1, a_2, dots , a_ N. Output Output an integer representing the number of ways. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 1 2 3 4 4 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 6 1 1 3 3 4 6 10
