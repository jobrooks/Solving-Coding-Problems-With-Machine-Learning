Ms. Alice was working on making some factoring homework for her students last week, where the students get questions in the form of ax^2+bx+c, and must rewrite the expression in the form (dx+ e)(fx + g), where a,b,c,d,e,f,g are integers. She is done making the questions, but wants someone to check them over to make sure the expressions are factorable. The expression ax^2+bx+c is factorable if and only if the expression ax^2+bx+c is able to be successfully rewritten in the form (dx+ e)(fx + g), where a,b,c,d,e,f,g are integers. To help Ms. Alice, you must check if each question is factorable! Input The first line contains the number of test cases 0<nle 100. The next n lines each consist of three space separated integers 0<a,b,cleq 10^{8}. Output For each test case, output a line consisting of “YES” if factorable, and “NO” otherwise. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 4 1 2 1 1 3 1 24 73 24 12 33 6 YES NO YES NO
