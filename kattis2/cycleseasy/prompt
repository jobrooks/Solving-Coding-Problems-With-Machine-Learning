Note that this is an easier version of the problem cycleshard. You are given a complete undirected graph with n nodes numbered from 1 to n. You are also given k forbidden edges in this graph. You are asked to find the number of Hamiltonian cycles in this graph that donâ€™t use any of the given k edges. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. A cycle that contains the same edges is only counted once. For example, cycles 1 2 3 4 1 and 1 4 3 2 1 and 2 3 4 1 2 are all the same, but 1 3 2 4 1 is different. Input The first line of input gives the number of cases, T. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers, n and k. The next k lines contain two integers each, representing the vertices of a forbidden edge. There will be no self-edges and no repeated edges. You may assume that 1 leq T leq 10, 0 leq k leq 15 and 3 leq n leq 10. Output For each test case, output one line containing "Case #X: Y", where X is the case number (starting from 1) and Y is the number of Hamiltonian cycles that do not include any of those k edges. Print your answer modulo 9901. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 4 1 1 2 8 4 1 2 2 3 4 5 5 6 Case #1: 1 Case #2: 660
