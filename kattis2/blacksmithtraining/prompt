Photo by Fir0002 Zapray is playing the game World of Warcraft Classic. In the game he needs to train his blacksmith skill from level 0 to level 300. He will improve his blacksmith skill by crafting items described in blacksmith plans. Blacksmith plans are taught by trainers around the world. There are n plans available for Zapray to learn. Plan i is taught at a price of p_ i gold, and has an entry level e_ i and a master level m_ i. Zapray can only learn the plan if his blacksmith skill level is at least e_ i. After learning the plan, Zapray can craft the item described in the plan, such as a piece of armor or a weapon. He may craft as many items as he wishes using plan i, but he must pay d_ i gold for the materials of each item to craft. Zapray’s blacksmith skill will level up by one after he crafts an item using any blacksmith plan. However, once Zapray’s skill level reaches the master level m_ i, plan i becomes too elementary for Zapray and crafting an item using plan i can no longer increase his skill level. Zapray wants to know the minimum amount of gold he needs to spend to train his blacksmith skill to level 300. Input The input starts with a single integer n (1 leq n leq 80) on the first line. The ith of the following n lines consists of four integers e_ i, m_ i, p_ i, d_ i (0 leq e_ i < m_ i leq 300, 0 leq p_ i, d_ i leq 10^6) that describe the ith blacksmith plan. It is guaranteed that Zapray’s blacksmith skill can reach level 300 from level 0 with the given set of plans. Output Output the minimum amount of gold Zapray needs to spend.
