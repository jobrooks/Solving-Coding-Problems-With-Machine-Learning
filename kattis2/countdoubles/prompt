Given an array of n positive integers and an integer m, count how many contiguous subarrays of exactly m elements have two or more even values. For example, given the subarray 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and m = 3, the three subarrays 2 3 4, 4 5 6, and 6 7 8 each have at least two even values. Input The first line of input consists of the size 1leq nleq 10^3 of the array, followed by m<n, the subarray size. Then n positive integers, each at most 10^3, follow on the second line. Output Output how many contiguous subarrays of m elements have at least two even elements. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 8 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 3 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 9 4 1 2 3 5 7 8 9 11 5 0
