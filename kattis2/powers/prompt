Image by geralt One day you and GTmac walk into a classroom and see a mysterious expression on the blackboard:\[ (1^ b + 2^ b + \cdots + a^ b)~ \mathrm{mod}~ a \] Upon seeing the expression GTmac shows an evil smile and challenges you: “Let me give you the values of a and b and let’s assume b is an odd number. Want to bet who can evaluate this expression? The one who loses shall buy pizza for us tonight.” Input The input has two integers a (1 leq a leq 10^9) and b (1leq bleq 99, b is odd) on a single line. Output Output the value of the expression with the given a and b. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 3 1 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 3 7 0 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 12345678 9 6172839
