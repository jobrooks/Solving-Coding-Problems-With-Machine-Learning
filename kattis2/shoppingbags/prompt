As usual, you forgot your reusable shopping bags at home. I guess you have to buy some paper bags. You only have two items on your shopping list, but you need to stock up on a certain quantity of each item since you are planing to throw a party. Each item has a size and the paper bags have a maximum total size they can hold. You will want to buy the fewest possible bags. More precisely, you need to buy N_1 copies of the first item and N_2 copies of the second item. Each copy of the first item has size S_1 and each copy of the second has size S_2. The bags you can buy all have capacity T, meaning they can hold any collection of items whose total size is at most T. Determine the fewest bags you must buy such that it is possible to distribute N_1 copies of the first item and N_2 copies of the second item between these bags while ensuring each bag receives a total item size of at most T. Input The first line of input contains a single integer T (1 leq T leq 10^9). The second line contains integers N_1 and N_2 (1 leq N_1, N_2 leq 2, 000) indicating the number of copies of the two items you must buy. The third line contains integers S_1 and S_2 (1 leq S_1, S_2 leq T) giving the size of a single copy of the respective item. Additionally, the second item will be pretty big: S_2 geq T/4. Output Output a single integer B on a line by itself indicating the fewest shopping bags that you need to purchase in order to pack all items into the bags.
