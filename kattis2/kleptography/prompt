John likes simple ciphers. He had been using the “Caesar” cipher to encrypt his diary until recently, when he learned a hard lesson about its strength by catching his sister Mary browsing through the diary without any problems. Rapidly searching for an alternative, John found a solution: the famous “Autokey” cipher. He uses a version that takes the 26 lower-case letters ‘a’–‘z’ and internally translates them in alphabetical order to the numbers 0 to 25. The encryption key k begins with a secret prefix of n letters. Each of the remaining letters of the key is copied from the letters of the plaintext a, so that k_{n+i} = a_{i} for i geq 1. Encryption of the plaintext a to the ciphertext b follows the formula b_ i = a_ i + k_ i bmod 26. Mary is not easily discouraged. She was able to get a peek at the last n letters John typed into his diary on the family computer before he noticed her, quickly encrypted the text document with a click, and left. This could be her chance. Input The input consists of: One line with two integers n and m (1 le n le 30, n + 1 le m le 100), where n is the length of the keyword as well as the number of letters Mary saw, and m is the length of the text. One line with n lower-case letters, the last n letters of the plaintext. One line with m lower-case letters, the whole ciphertext. Output Output the plaintext of John’s diary.
