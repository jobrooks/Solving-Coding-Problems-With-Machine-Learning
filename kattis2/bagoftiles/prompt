You and your friend are playing a game involving chance, and you are interested in the odds of winning the game. The game proceeds as follows: Your friend chooses m tiles, each labeled with a positive integer. He shows them to you, and puts them in a bag. He then chooses an integer 0 leq n leq m, and tells you what it is. You choose an integer t (the ‘target’), and tell your friend what it is. Your friend reaches into the bag (without looking!) and draws out n of the tiles, all at once. If the sum of the drawn tiles equals t, you win. Otherwise, you lose. Write a program that determines the odds of you winning at this game. Assume that, when drawing out n tiles, each tile in the bag has the same probability of being chosen. Input Input starts with an integer 1 leq g leq 200 indicating the number of games that follow. Each game description has three lines. The first contains an integer 0 < m leq 30, indicating the number of tiles in the bag. The second line contains m labels of the tiles in the bag. Each tile’s label will be an integer in the range 1 to 10,000. The third line contains the two integers n and t, where 0leq nleq m and 0leq t < 10, 000. Output For each game, print the odds that you win that game. Print the odds in the form “Game n – a : b”, where a represents the number of possible draws that would cause you to win, and b represents the number of possible draws that would cause you to lose.
