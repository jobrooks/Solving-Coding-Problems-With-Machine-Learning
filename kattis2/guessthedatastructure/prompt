There is a bag-like data structure, supporting two operations: 1 x: Throw an element x into the bag. 2: Take out an element from the bag. Given a sequence of operations with return values, you’re going to guess the data structure. It is a stack (Last-In, First-Out), a queue (First-In, First-Out), a priority-queue (Always take out larger elements first) or something else that you can hardly imagine! Input There are several test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer n (1leq nleq 1000). Each of the next n lines is either a type-1 command, or an integer 2 followed by an integer x. This means that executing the type-2 command returned the element x. The value of x is always a positive integer not larger than 100. The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF). The size of input file does not exceed 1MB. Output For each test case, output one of the following: stack It’s definitely a stack. queue It’s definitely a queue. priority queue It’s definitely a priority queue. impossible It can’t be a stack, a queue or a priority queue. not sure It can be more than one of the three data structures mentioned above.
