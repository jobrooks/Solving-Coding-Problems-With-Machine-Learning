A cellular provider has installed n towers to support their network. Each tower provides coverage in a 1text { km} radius, and no two towers are closer than 1text { km} to each other. The coverage region of this network is therefore the set of all points that are no more than 1text { km} away from at least one tower. The provider wants as much of this region as possible to be connected, in the sense that a user at any point within a connected subregion can travel to any other point within the connected subregion without having to exit the subregion. Their current installation of towers may or may not already form a single connected region, but they have the resources to build one more tower wherever they want, including within 1text { km} of an existing tower. Given that the provider is able to build one more tower, what is the maximum number of towers (including the new one) that can be included within a single connected subregion of coverage? Input Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input consists of a single integer n (1 le n le 5, 000) denoting the number of existing towers. Next follow n lines, each with 2 space-separated floating-point numbers x and y (0 le x, y le 100, 000, at most 5 digits after the decimal point), denoting the location of a tower in km. It is guaranteed that the optimal number of towers will not change even if the coverage radius of all the towers is increased or decreased by 10^{-6}text { km}. Output Output a single integer, denoting the maximum number of towers that can be within a single connected subregion of the network after installing one additional tower.
