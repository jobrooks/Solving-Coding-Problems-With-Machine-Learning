Harvard linguistics professor George Kingsley Zipf (1902-1950) observed that the frequency of the kth most common word in a text is roughly proportional to 1/k. He justified his observations in a book titled Human behavior and the principle of least effort published in 1949. While Zipfâ€™s rationale has largely been discredited, the principle still holds, and others have afforded it a more sound mathematical basis. You are to find all the words occurring n times in an English text. A word is a sequence of letters. Words are separated by non-letters. Capitalization should be ignored. A word can be of any length that an English word can be. Input Input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains a single positive integer n. Several lines of text follow which will contain no more than 10, 000 words. The text for each case is terminated by a single line containing EndOfText. EndOfText does not appear elsewhere in the input and is not considered a word. Output For each test case, output the words which occur n times in the input text, one word per line, lower case, in alphabetical order. If there are no such words in input, output the following line: There is no such word. Leave a blank line between cases. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 In practice, the difference between theory and practice is always greater than the difference between theory and practice in theory. - Anonymous Man will occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of the time he will pick himself up and continue on. - W.
