Damir likes to rotate. Right now he is rotating tables of letters. He wrote an Rtimes C table onto a piece of paper. He has also chosen an angle K, a multiple of 45, and wants to rotate his table that many degrees clockwise. It turns out this task is a bit too hard for Damir, so help him out. Input The first line contains two integers R and C separated by a space (1 leq R leq 10, 1 leq C leq 10), the number of rows and columns in Damir’s table. Each of the next R lines contains one row of Damir’s table, a string of C lowercase letters. The last line contains an integer K, a multiple of 45 between 0 and 360 (inclusive). Output Output Damir’s table rotated K degrees clockwise, like shown in the examples. The output should contain the smallest number of rows necessary. Some rows may have leading spaces, but no rows may have trailing spaces.
