A finished and an unfinished pyramid of height 4. Kim likes building Lego pyramids and now wants to build one of height H. How many more bricks are needed if Kim already has N bricks of size 2 times 2 and M bricks of size 4 times 2? A pyramid is hollow and consists of H layers, as shown in the image. The kth layer has width 2k for 1leq kleq H. Input Three integers 1 leq H leq 1, 000, 0 leq N leq 10^6, and 0 leq M leq 10^6. Output Print two integers A and B on a single line, where A is the number of extra 2 times 2-bricks needed and B is the number of extra 4 times 2-bricks. You must use as few extra bricks as possible, so you must minimise A+B. If there is more than one such solution, print the one maximising A. Explanation of Sample 2 Sample input 2 corresponds to the situation shown in the image. Starting with the bricks in the unfinished pyramid to the right, Kim can build the left pyramid using an extra 2 times 2-brick and 4 extra 4 times 2-bricks. There is no way to finish a height-4 pyramid with fewer than 5 extra bricks. Note that it is also possible to build a height-4 pyramid using 5 extra bricks of size 4times 2 (and no extra 2times 2-bricks). However, the sample output is correct because it uses more extra 2 times 2-bricks.
