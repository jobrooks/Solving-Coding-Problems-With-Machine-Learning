Oh no! Chalmers Challenge is only one day away and Chalmers Coding Club havenâ€™t had the time to prepare all tasks. As we all know, competitive programming problems are created by combining funny problem statements with computer programming methods. There are A_{uniq}+A_{reuse} problem statement themes and B_{uniq}+B_{reuse} algorithmic methods. Some of these are one-trick ponies that only work once while others are so good they never get old. Out of all the themes and methods, only A_{reuse} and B_{reuse} are good enough to be reused continually. How many different problems can be created by combining all these themes and methods? Input Input consists of one line with four space-separated integers: 0 le A_{uniq}, B_{uniq}, A_{reuse}, B_{reuse} le 10^9, the number of single-use themes and methods and the number of reusable themes and methods respectively. Output Output a single integer, the number of problems that can be created in total. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2 3 0 0 2 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 7 3 0 3 7 Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 82 31 21 44 1037 Sample Input 4 Sample Output 4 0 2 1 0 2
