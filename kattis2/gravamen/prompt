“Next to the confrontation between two highly honed batteries of lawyers, jungle warfare is a stately minuet.” ­–Bill Veeck. Frivolous lawsuit or legitimate litigation? That is the question the judge Kattis faces today as she presides over lawsuits between individuals and corporations. There are R individuals and S corporations involved in lawsuits that Kattis must preside over today. For simplicity, we label the individuals 1, 2, dots , R and the corporations 1, 2, dots , S. Each of the individuals and corporations is involved in at least one of the L lawsuits; each lawsuit involves exactly one individual and one corporation, and in particular, the i^text {th} of these lawsuits involves the individual A_ i and the corporation B_ i. There has been a growing resentment among the populace that judges tend to be biased, and Kattis really wants to be known as an equitable and fair judge. For each lawsuit, she needs to rule in favor of one party or the other; the party she rules in favor of is said to have “won” the lawsuit. In an aggressive bid to improve her optics, she has decided to ignore the merits of the arguments involved (as the public is incapable of nuanced discussion anyway), but to rule in such a way that no single individual or corporation wins too many lawsuits, so as to avoid accusations of bias. That is, she wants to make rulings with the goal of minimizing the maximum number of lawsuits any single individual or corporation wins. What ruling should she make for each lawsuit? Input The first line of input contains three integers, R (1 leq R leq 2, 000), S (1 leq S leq 2, 000) and L (max (R, S) leq L leq 2, 000) the number of individuals, the number of corporations and the number of lawsuits. The next L lines contain the descriptions of the lawsuits. In particular, the i^text {th} of these lines contains two integers A_ i (1 leq A_ i leq R) and B_ i (1 leq B_ i leq S), denoting that the i^text {th} lawsuit involves individual A_ i and corporation B_ i. It is guaranteed that each individual and corporation is involved in at least one lawsuit. Note that it is possible for the same pair of one individual and one corporation to be involved in more than one lawsuit. Output Output L lines, where the i^text {th} of these lines contains either INDV A_ i or CORP B_ i, describing the party Kattis should rule in favor of for the i^text {th} lawsuit, such that the maximum number of lawsuits any single individual or corporation wins is minimized. If there are multiple correct answers, you can output any of them.
