The Ionian Commission on Procuring Cash has come up with a new gambling game to raise funds for the government. The game is played as follows: Each week, the government will televise a set of m balls (numbered 1 ldots m) being selected one at a time without replacement. Anyone who wants to play will have to buy a game card. Each card contains n squares (where n leq m/2) and in each square are two numbers between 1 and m. No number appears more than once on a card. A sample card is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Sample game card with m=10, n=4 and p=5. After each ball is selected, players cover any square which contains that number (there will be at most one such square on any card). Each game card also has a number p printed on it, and a contestant wins if he or she covers all n squares after exactly p ball selections (i.e., prior to the p^{text {th}} selection, they only had n-1 squares covered). Before issuing cards to its citizens, the government would like to get an idea of the likelihood of winning for various values of m, n and p so they can set up the payoffs appropriately. They have procured you to write a program to solve this problem. Input Input consists of a single line containing 3 integers m, n and p, as described above, where 2 leq m leq 33, 0 leq n leq m/2 and 0 leq p leq m. Output Output the probability of winning on the p^{text {th}} selection as a fraction x/y in simplest form. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 10 4 5 8/45 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 10 4 3 0/1
