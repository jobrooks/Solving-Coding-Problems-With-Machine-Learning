The teacher has sent an e-mail to her students with the following task: “Write a program that will determine and output the value of X if given the statement:\[ X = \mathit{number}_1^{\mathit{pow}_1} + \mathit{number}_2^{\mathit{pow}_2} + \ldots + \mathit{number}_ N^{\mathit{pow}_ N} \] and it holds that mathit{number}_1, mathit{number}_2 to mathit{number}_ N are integers, and mathit{pow}_1, mathit{pow_2} to mathit{pow}_ N are one-digit integers.” Unfortunately, when the teacher downloaded the task to her computer, the text formatting was lost so the task transformed into a sum of N integers:\[ X = P_1 + P_2 + \ldots + P_ N \] For example, without text formatting, the original task in the form of X = 21^2 + 125^3 became a task in the form of X = 212 + 1253. Help the teacher by writing a program that will, for given N integers from P_1 to P_ N determine and output the value of X from the original task. Input The first line of input contains the integer N (1 leq N leq 10), the number of the addends from the task. Each of the following N lines contains the integer P_ i (10 leq P_ i leq 9999, i = 1, ldots , N) from the task. Output The first and only line of output must contain the value of X (X leq 1, 000, 000, 000) from the original task.
