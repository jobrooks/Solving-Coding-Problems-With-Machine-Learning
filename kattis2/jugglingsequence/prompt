The Juggling Sequence is an integer sequence with n elements, defined as follow: a_1 = 1, For every i geq 1: If a_ i leq i, then a_{i+1} = a_ i + i, If a_ i > i, then a_{i+1} = a_ i - i. Let’s sort the juggling sequence in non-decreasing order. What is the m-th number? Input The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 le t le 10^4) — the number of test cases. t test cases follow, each test case contains a single line with two integers n and m (1 le m le n le 10^{18}). Output For each test case, print a single integer — the m-th number in the sorted juggling sequence. Explanation of the sample input With n = 6, the juggling sequence is 1, 2, 4, 1, 5, 10. After sorting, the sequence becomes 1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 6 1 6 2 6 6 1 1 10
