Hunters from all over the world are gathering in Yorknew — where the ‘International Hunter Programming Contest 2020’ will take place. As Gon has previously passed the final round of Hunter Exam and became a Hunter, you may be able to see Gon in Yorknew! There is exactly one road leading to Yorknew — an infinitely long and narrow road. For simplicity, you can imagine the road as a straight line. h Hunters are going to Yorknew city. The i-th Hunter is currently at location x_ i. Yorknew city is at location 0. The Hunters all walk very fast — they move with velocity of 1 unit per second. To avoid traffic jam, Yorknew city administrators have decided to build two portals. It takes exactly 0 second to teleport from one portal to the other. Hunters may choose to use or not use a portal as they wish. The administrators want to place the two portals at some integer positions on the road, such that the total time it takes for all h Hunter to reach Yorknew city is as small as possible. Input The first line of the input contains exactly one integer h — the number of Hunters (1 le h le 10^5). The second line contains exactly h integers: the i-th number, x_ i is the current location of the i-th Hunter. (-10^9 le x_ i le 10^9). Output Print only one integer — the total time it takes for all Hunters to reach Yorknew city. Explanation of sample test There are 3 Hunters, at locations 4, 5 and 6. An optimal plan is to place two portals at 0 and 5. The time it takes for the 3 Hunters to reach Yorknew city are: 1, 0 and 1. Thus, the total time is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.
