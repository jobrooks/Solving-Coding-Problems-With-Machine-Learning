Image by Andrey Druc (Shutterstock); Used under license Two positive integers, x and y, are called digit-preserving if their product, xy, contains exactly the same digits as x and y contain together, including repetitions. For example, if x = 807 and y = 984, then their product, 794088, contains textrm{one}~ 7, textrm{one}~ 9, textrm{one}~ 4, textrm{one}~ 0, and textrm{two}~ 8textrm{'s}, which is exactly the same set of digits and corresponding frequencies as in 807 and 984 combined. Given an interval, [A,B], find all digit-preserving pairs, x, y, in the interval. This means that both x and y are in [A,B], but note that their product, xy, is not required to be in [A,B]. To avoid double-counting, you can assume x leq y (this avoids, for example, treating (807, 984) and (984, 807) as different digit-preserving pairs). Input The input consists of a single line containing two space-separated integers, A and B, with 1 leq A leq B leq 2, 500. Output First output a single line containing “n digit-preserving pair(s)”, where n is the number of digit-preserving pairs in [A,B]. Then output n lines, each of which contains one of the digit-preserving pairs and the corresponding product. Carefully format your output as in the sample output (note the single space separating adjacent tokens). These lines should be sorted by increasing value textrm{of}~ x, breaking ties by increasing value textrm{of}~ y.
