After returning from Wonderland, Alice needs to improve her scientific skills in the current digital world. Alice decides to participate the ACM - ICPC Asia Nha Trang Regional Contest 2016 to evaluate her actual performance. Her favorite problem in the contest is described below. Given an array of positive integers A = {a}_{1}, {a}_{2},ldots , {a}_{n}, a subarray {A}_{i}^{j} of A is a sequence of continuous elements in A, i.e., {A}_{i}^{j} = {a}_{i}, {a}_{i+1},ldots , {a}_{j} (where 1 leq i leq j leq  n). The weight of {A}_{i}^{j} is the sum of all its elements, i.e., sum _{k=i}^{j} {a}_{k}. Given an integer m, your task is to find the maximum weight subarray of A that contains only one m as the minimum element. You can assume that A always contains at least one element with value m. Input The input consists of several datasets. The first line of the input contains the number of datasets, which is a positive number and is not greater than 20. The following lines describe the datasets. Each dataset is described by the following lines: The first line contains two positive integers n and m where n leq {10}^{5} and m leq {2}^{6}; The second line contains n positive integers, each with value at most {2}^{6}. Output For each dataset, output the maximum weight. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 1 6 2 1 3 2 6 2 4 12
