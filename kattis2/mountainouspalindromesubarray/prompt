An array is Mountainous if it is strictly increasing, then strictly decreasing. Note that Mountainous arrays must therefore be of length three or greater. A Subarray is defined as an array that can be attained by deleting some prefix and suffix (possibly empty) from the original array. An array or subarray is a Palindrome if it is the same sequence forwards and backwards. Given an array of integers, compute the length of the longest Subarray that is both Mountainous and a Palindrome. Input The first line of input contains an integer n (1 le n le 10^6), which is the number of integers in the array. Each of the next n lines contains a single integer x (1 le x le 10^9). These values form the array. They are given in order. Output Output a single integer, which is the length of the longest Mountainous Palindromic Subarray, or -1 of no such array exists. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 8 2 1 2 3 2 1 7 8 5 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 5 2 5 8 7 2 -1
