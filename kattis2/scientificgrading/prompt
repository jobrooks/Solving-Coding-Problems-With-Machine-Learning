You recently started working as a TA (teaching assistant) for your university’s Scientific Computing class. Today, Professor introduced the scientific notation, where numbers are written in the form m times 10^ n with a real number m (the significand) and an integer n (the exponent). At the end of class, she gave students the following assignment. Given two numbers x, y in scientific notation, perform the following four arithmetic operations: x + y x - y x times y x / y As a strict grader, you decided to write a program to grade students’ answers. You mark a solution correct if and only if both relative and absolute errors are less than 10^{-9} (not including 10^{-9}). If the correct answer is 0, then 0 is the only acceptable answer. Otherwise, a student’s answer z will be compared to the correct answer tilde{z}, and the relative and absolute errors are computed as frac{|z - tilde{z}|}{|tilde{z}|} and |z - tilde{z}|, respectively. Input The first line of input contains the value of x, and the second line contains the value of y. The next four lines contain a student’s answer to x+y, x-y, x times y, and x/y. All numbers are in the form of <SIGNIFICAND>e<EXPONENT>. The significand m starts with a sign (+ or -), followed by one digit, a period (.), and exactly nine digits. The exponent n also starts with a sign (+ or -) and is followed by an integer between 0 and 10^9, inclusively. The value is computed by m times 10^ n. The value 0 is always represented as +0.000000000e+0, and for any nonzero values the first digit of their significand is not 0. It is guaranteed that x and y are both nonzero. Output For each student solution, output Correct if it is considered correct and Incorrect otherwise. The first line of output indicates if the student’s solution to x+y is correct, the second line indicates if their solution to x-y is correct, the third line indicates if their solution to x times y is correct, and the fourth line indicates if their solution to x/y is correct.
