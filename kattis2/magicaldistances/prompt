Photo by TVZ Design There are n cities in the Magical Island, numbered from 1 to n. These cities are connected by m bi-directional roads such that there exists a path between every pair of cities. There may be multiple roads between two cities. Each road has a positive length. Magical crystals are the most important resources transported between the cities in the Magical Island. The cost of sending one magical crystal from city s to city t equals the smallest distance of any path between city s and city t. The distance of a path in the Magical Island is a bit special though: It is the bitwise OR value of all the road lengths on this path. In each of the next q days, exactly one magical crystal will be transported between a pair of cities. Help the Magical Island figure out the transportation cost for each day. Input The first line contains two integers n, m (2leq nleq 10^5,1leq mleq n+200). Each of the next m lines contains three integers a, b, w that describe a road connecting city a and city b with length w (1leq a, bleq n, a neq b, 1leq w leq 10^9). In the next line, there is a single integer q (1leq qleq 10, 000), the number of days to consider. The next q lines each have two integers s and t (1leq s, tleq n, s neq t). The ith line indicates that on day i a crystal is sent from city s to city t. Output For each of the q days, output the cost of sending the crystal from s to t for that day.
