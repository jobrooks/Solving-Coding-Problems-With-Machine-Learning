In order to build a staircase to a famous pagoda on top of a mountain, the local authority has identified N positions along the mountain slope a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ N where a_ i is the height of the i-th position and a_ i leq a_{i+1} for all 0<i<N. The cost to build a staircase from position i to position j is min _{v in mathbb {Z}}{sum _{s=i}^{j}{|a_ s-v|^ k}} To speed up the process of building the staircase from position 1 to position N, the local authority has decided to give the job to G builders to build the staircase in parallel. The sequence of N positions will be divided into G segments of consecutive positions where every position belongs to exactly one segment and each segment is managed by exactly one builder. Given an integer G (1 leq G leq N), your task is to identify a way to allocate jobs to G builders to minimize their total building costs. Input The first line contains 3 integers N, G, k (1 leq N leq 2, 000, ; 1 leq G leq N, ; 1 leq k leq 2). The second line contains N integers a_1, a_2, ldots , a_ N (1 leq a_ i leq 10^6, ; a_ i leq a_{i+1} ; forall ; 0<i<N). Output Print the minimum building cost required.
