Mirko decided to open a new business—bank vaults. A branch of the bank can be visualized in a plane, vaults being points in the plane. Mirko’s branch contains exactly Lcdot (A+1+B) vaults, so that each point with integer coordinates inside the rectangle with corners (1, -A) and (L, B) contains one vault. The vaults are watched by two guards—one at (0, -A), the other at (0, B). A guard can see a vault if there are no other vaults on the line segment connecting them. A vault is not secure if neither guard can see it, secure if only one guard can see it and super-secure if both guards can see it. Given A, B and L, output the number of insecure, secure and super-secure vaults. Input The first line contains integers A and B separated by a space (1 leq A leq 2, 000, 1 leq B leq 2, 000). The second line contains the integer L (1 leq L leq 1, 000, 000, 000). Output Output on three separate lines the numbers of insecure, secure and super-secure vaults.
