You have always dreamt to get your name on the Stanley Cup, but you have never played hockey. A friend of yours heard of an alternative: the Combinatorial Stanley Cup! If you solve a single programming problem, you will get your name on this purely fictional trophy. What an opportunity! The problem is simple: for a given N, find the number of odd coefficients in the binomial (1+x)^ N. Oh! Thereâ€™s a catch: N can be as big as 2 billions! Input The only line in the input is an integer 0 leq N leq 2, 000, 000, 000, the degree of the binomial (1+x)^ N for which you need to determine how many of its coefficients are odd. Output The number of odd coefficients. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 0 1 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 1 2
