Match sticks can be used to form digital numbers. The arrangement of matches that forms each digit between ‘0’ and ‘9’ is illustrated in the figure. You are given two sequences of digits X and Y. There are matches that have been arranged to form the digits in X. Can you move exactly one match from them, so that the resulting matches form the other sequence Y? Input The input contains one line with two sequences of digits X and Y. It is guaranteed that X and Y have the same length but are different sequences. Each sequence contains digits between ‘0’ and ‘9’ and has at least one and no more than 12 digits. A sequence may contain leading zeros. Output Output “yes” if it is possible to move exactly one match to change X into Y. Otherwise output “no”. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 60 58 yes Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 046 040 yes Sample Input 3 Sample Output 3 1178 1140 no
