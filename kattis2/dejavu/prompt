N points are placed in the coordinate plane. Write a program that calculates how many ways we can choose three points so that they form a right triangle with legs parallel to the coordinate axes. A right triangle has one 90-degree internal angle. The legs of a right triangle are its two shorter sides. Input The first line of input contains the integer N (3 le N le 100, 000), the number of points. Each of the following N lines contains two integers X and Y (1 le X, Y le 100, 000), the coordinates of one point. No pair of points will share the same pair of coordinates. Output Output the number of triangles.
