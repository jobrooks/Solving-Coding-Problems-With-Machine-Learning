Input The first line of input consists of two integers n, q, where 1 leq n leq 10^8 and 1 leq q leq 20000. Then follow q lines, each containing an integer x satisfying 1 leq x leq n. Output On the first line of output, write one line giving the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n. Then for each query x, output 1 if x is a prime and ouput 0 if x is composite.
