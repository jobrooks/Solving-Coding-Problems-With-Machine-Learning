During a game of Minesweeper you have arrived in the situation shown in the image, with an ntimes n square surrounded by 1s, themselves surrounded by unknown cells. Your task is to determine which of the 4n+4 surrounding 1-cells is guaranteed to not contain a mine. If you are unfamiliar with the rules of Minesweeper, here is a description: Each of the red-labelled cells is either empty or contains a mine. All other cells are empty. Each cell with a blue 1 is adjacent to exactly one mine. Two cells are said to be adjacent if they share an edge or a corner. Thus, except at the border, every cell is adjacent to 8 other cells. Determine which of the red-labelled cells are safe, i.e., guaranteed to not contain a mine. Input An integer n with 1 leq n leq 1, 000, the side length of the square. The image corresponds to n = 6. It can be shown that there exists at least one valid placement of mines for each n. Output First print the number m of safe cells. Then print a line with m integers, the indices of the safe cells in increasing order. The cells are indexed clockwise from 1 to 4n+4, starting at the bottom left corner, as shown in the image. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 8 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 1 0
