The ACM (Advanced Cosmos Monitor) recorded a set of messages transmitted by alien race of Space Invaders. Unfortunately, the antenna used for recording only handles lower frequencies representing numbers and two arithmetical operators in space-invaderian language, while all parentheses (corresponding to a high frequency) were lost. Since numbers are important for those 8-bit creatures, we really need to know what number ranges these messages belong to — please, write a program that can do this for us! Input Input contains at most 1 500 legal arithmetical expressions, each expression on a separate line. Each expression consists only of non-negative integers x_ i (0 leq x_ i leq 100) and binary operators “+” and “*”. The expression starts with a number, then the operators and numbers alternate, and the last element is a number. Each expression contains P numbers (1 leq P leq 100) and P - 1 operators. There are no parentheses, no other operators, no unary operator, etc. The last input expression is followed by a line containing the single word “END”. Output For each input line (not counting the final END), output one line containing the minimum and maximum values (separated by a single space) that are achievable by adding parentheses to the input in a way that forms a legal expression and computing the result of that expression. For example, the minimum value for 2 + 1 cdot 0 input is achieved by (2 + 1) cdot 0 and the maximum value is achieved by 2 + (1 cdot 0). Therefore, you should print “0 2”. It is guaranteed that for any placement of parentheses, the value of each parenthesis will be less than 2^{63}. This means that also the maximal result will be between 0 and 2^{63} - 1, inclusive. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 2+1*0 3+2*5+1*7+16 0 END 0 2 36 690 0 0
