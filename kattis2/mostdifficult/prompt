You are an expert on the most difficult field of math — primes! Indeed, you have actually proven the Riemann Hypothesis, but unfortunately, this margin is too narrow to contain the proof. Being considered a prime expert, q people have come to you for help. The i-th person has a favorite number x_ i, and they want to find the primmest prime number with respect to x_ i — that is, the smallest prime number p such that both p and x_ i + p are prime! Unfortunately, there are too many people, and you don’t want to spend your time answering such trivial questions. Instead, you decide to write a program to answer all of their questions! Input The first line contains an integer q, denoting the number of people (1 leq q leq 100). The next q lines each contain an integer x_ i, denoting the favorite number of the i-th person (1 leq x_ i leq 10^{18}). Output Output q lines, where the i-th line contains the primmest prime p with respect to x_ i. If there is no such prime p where both p and x_ i + p are primes, output -1 instead.
