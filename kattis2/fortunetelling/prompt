What you see is only a moment dots  In an attempt to earn enough money to support her activities, the Great Witch of Calamity has taken up a new side job: fortune telling! Her setup involves two decks of cards colored blue and black, respectively. The blue cards are numbered 1 to X from top to bottom, and the black cards are numbered similarly from 1 to Y. She will put all these cards into the Pile of Fate via the following operations. She may do them in any order, and as many times as she wishes: If she has less than two cards in her hand, she may draw one card from either the deck of blue cards, or the deck of black cards, as long as the deck she draws from is nonempty. If she has at least one card in her hand, she may place any of these cards into the Pile of Fate. Both her hand and the Pile of Fate start out empty. When she is done, she will then read her clientâ€™s fortune from the arrangement of cards in the Pile of Fate. Because every arrangement leads to a different fortune, she wonders how many arrangements are possible. Can you answer this? Input Format The only line of input contains two space-separated integers X and Y: the number of blue and the number of black cards, respectively. It holds that 0 leq X, Y leq 10^5 and 1 leq X + Y. Output Format Output one integer: the number of possible fortunes (i.e. final arrangements of cards). Since this may be very large, output the answer modulo 998, 244, 353. Explanation To help explain the first sample test case, let the ith blue card be labeled A_ i, and the ith black card be labeled B_ i. For the first test case, there are 60 possible final arrangements. One of them, from bottom to top, is\[ A_1, B_2, A_2, B_1, B_3 \] She can achieve this via the following set of operations: Pick up A_1, then pick up B_1, then discard A_1. Pick up and discard B_2, and A_2. Note that B_1 is still in her hand. Discard B_1. Pick up and discard B_3. Note that there may be other sequences of operations that can obtain this arrangement. Despite this, we only count this arrangement once. For the second test case, remember to reduce the answer by the given modulo.
