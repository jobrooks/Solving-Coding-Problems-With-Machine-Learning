Young Luka is about to enter a house with the evil witch Marica inside. As soon as he enters the house, she asks him questions about her array of N numbers. Luka fearfully asks for a clarification of the questions. Marica explains to him that each query consists of two integers L and R which represent the positions of a contiguous sub-array in her array. It is Luka’s task to answer for each query what the longest contiguous sub-array of that contiguous sub-array (it can be the entire sub-array) having the property of being magical. An array is called magical if all the values are between the values of the first and last number in that array. For example, [1 3 1 2 4] is magical, the same as [4 1 1 2 1], whereas [3 3 4 1] is not magical. Input The first line of input contains the integer N (1 leq N leq 500, 000), the number of numbers in the array. The second line contains N integers a_ i (1 leq a_ i leq 10^9). The third line contains the integer Q (1 leq Q leq 500, 000), the number of queries. Each of the following Q lines contains two integers, L and R (1 leq L leq R leq N), representing the sub-array from the query. Output The i-th line of output must contain a single integer—the answer to the i-th query. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 5 5 4 3 3 2 3 1 2 1 1 2 4 2 1 3 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 6 6 6 5 1 6 2 3 4 5 4 6 1 4 2 2 4
