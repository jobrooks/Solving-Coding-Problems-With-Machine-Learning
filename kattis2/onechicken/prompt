Dr. Chaz is hosting a programming contest wrap up dinner. Dr. Chaz has severe OCD and is very strict on rules during dinner, specifically, he needs to be sure that everyone take exactly 1 piece of chicken at his buffet, even if that will result in an enormous amount of leftovers. This is why every year before the dinner, Dr. Chaz would give a powerful speech: “Everyone, one chicken per person!” However, Dr. Chaz does not always have an idea how many pieces of chicken he needs, he believes if there are N people at the buffet and everyone takes exactly 1 piece of chicken, providing M pieces of chicken will be perfect, i.e., is enough and will have no leftovers.
