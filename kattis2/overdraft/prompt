Banks often charge overdraft fees if you attempt to withdraw more money from your account than is available in your current balance. Given a sequence of deposits and withdrawals (and assuming each deposit and withdrawal is immediately reflected in your balance), determine the minimum (non-negative) starting balance you need to ensure that you will not be charged any overdraft fees over the course of the sequence. Input The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 le n le 1{,}000), which is the number of transactions. Each of the next n lines contains a single integer t (-10^6 le t le 10^6, t neq 0). These are the transactions, in the order that they occur. A positive number represents a deposit, a negative number represents a withdrawal. No two transactions occur simultaneously. Output Output a single non-negative integer, which is the minimum non-negative balance you must start with in your account in order to avoid any overdraft fees.
