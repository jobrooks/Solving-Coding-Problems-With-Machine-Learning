In this problem, your program should read two whole numbers (also called integers) from the input, and print them out in increasing order. As a refresher, here are some ways to read two numbers from standard input in a few different languages: # Python 3 line = input() a, b = line.split() a = int(a) b = int(b) // C++ // make sure to first "#include <iostream>" int a, b; std::cin >> a >> b; // Java // make sure to first "import java.util.Scanner;" Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in); int a = s.nextInt(), b = s.nextInt(); Input The input contains one line, which has two integers a and b, separated by a single space. The bounds on these values are 0 le a, b le 1, 000, 000. Output Output the smaller number first, and the larger number second. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 3 4 3 4 Sample Input 2 Sample Output 2 987 23 23 987
