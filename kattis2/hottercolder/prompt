The children’s game Hotter Colder is played as follows. Player A leaves the room while player B hides an object somewhere in the room. Player A re-enters at position (0,0) and then visits various other positions about the room. When player A visits a new position, player B announces “Hotter” if this position is closer to the object than the previous position; player B announces “Colder” if it is farther and “Same” if it is the same distance. Input Input consists of up to 50 lines, each containing an x,y coordinate pair followed by “Hotter”, “Colder”, or “Same”. Each pair represents a position within or at the boundary of the room, which may be assumed to be a square with opposite corners at (0,0) and (10,10). The coordinates are given with at most 2 decimals after the decimal point. Output For each line of input print a line giving the total area of the region in which the object may have been placed, accurate to an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{-6}. If there is no such region, we consider the answer to be 0. Sample Input 1 Sample Output 1 10.0 10.0 Colder 10.0 0.0 Hotter 0.0 0.0 Colder 10.0 10.0 Hotter 50 37.500000 12.50 0.0
