You’re competing in an outdoor paper airplane flying contest, and you want to predict how far your paper airplane will fly. Your design has a fixed factor k, such that if the airplane’s velocity is at least k, it will rise. If its velocity is less than k it will descend. Here is how your paper airplane will fly: You start by throwing your paper airplane with a horizontal velocity of v at a height of h. There is an external wind blowing with a strength of s. While h > 0, repeat the following sequence: Increase v by s. Then, decrease v by max (1, leftlfloor frac{v}{10} rightrfloor ). Note that leftlfloor frac{v}{10} rightrfloor  is the value of frac{v}{10}, rounded down to the nearest integer if it is not an integer. If v ge k, increase h by one. If 0 < v < k, decrease h by one. If h is zero after the decrease, set v to zero. If v le 0, set h to zero and v to zero. Your airplane now travels horizontally by v units. If s > 0, decrease it by 1. Compute how far the paper airplane travels horizontally. Input The single line of input contains four integers h, k, v, and s (1 le h, k, v, s le 10^3), where h is your starting height, k is your fixed factor, v is your starting velocity, and s is the strength of the wind. Output Output a single integer, which is the distance your airplane travels horizontally. It can be shown that this distance is always an integer.
