You are given two strings s, and t. Count the number of substrings of s that contain t as a subsequence at least once. Note that a substring and a subsequence both consist of characters from the original string, in order. In a substring, the characters must be contiguous in the original string, but in a subsequence, they are not required to be contiguous. In the string abcde, ace is a subsequence but not a substring. If s is aa and t is a, then the answer is 3: [a]a, [aa], and a[a]. Input Each test case will consist of exactly two lines. The first line will contain string s (1! le ! |s|! le ! 10^5, s! in ! [a{-}z]^*), with no other characters. The second line will contain string t (1! le ! |t|! le ! 100, |t|! le ! |s|, t! in ! [a{-}z]^*), with no other characters. Output Output a single integer, which is the number of substrings of s that contain t as a subsequence at least once.
