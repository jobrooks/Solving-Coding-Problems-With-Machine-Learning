Frederic Edward Xavier runs a very successful delivery company called FredEX. Heâ€™s been looking at driving records lately, and is not happy with the costs of delivery. He has made the following estimations: Driving from one intersection to the neighboring one costs B dollars Going straight through an intersection costs S dollars Turning right in an intersection costs R dollars Turning left in an intersection costs L dollars Delivering a package is free, but you still pay the cost for the turn/going straight in that intersection. FredEX operates in a city where the streets make up an infinite grid of square blocks, with intersections numbered from (-infty ,-infty ) to (infty ,infty ). Lower numbers on the x axis are to the left, and lower numbers on the y axis are down. The truck starts at the intersection (0, 0) but you may choose which direction it should face. There are N packages that must be delivered in a specific order. The truck cannot go in reverse, and cannot perform U-turns to go back the way it came. Help Frederic find out the cheapest way to deliver all N packages. Input The first line of the input is a line with five space-separated integers B, S, R, L and N. Then follow N lines, each with two space-separated integers X_ i and Y_ i, the x and y coordinates of the intersection for delivering package number i. The packages are listed in the order they must be delivered. Output Output the minimum cost of delivering all packages.
