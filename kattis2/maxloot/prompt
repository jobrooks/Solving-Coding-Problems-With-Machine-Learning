A burglar wants to maximize the value of his loot given that he has a limited carrying capacity. Which items should he choose? More precisely, there is for every item i a value v_{i} and a cost (or weight) c_{i}, and there is a maximum cost C. The object is to find a set S such that sum _{i in S} v_ i is maximal while sum _{i in S} c_ i le C. Furthermore, if the burglar breaks into a sweet shop, there will be a lot of items, but they wonâ€™t be very valuable. On the other hand, an art exhibition tends to have few, but very valuable objects. Careful field research has shown that the trade-off between total value V (the sum of all values) and number of items is captured by the inequality n + 2 log _{2} V le 75. Input The first line contains an integer 1 le T le 20 which is the number of test cases. Each test case consist of three lines. The first line contains the positive integer n, 1 le n le 60 and the integer capacity 1 le C le 2, 000, 000, 000. The next two lines consist of n space-separated positive integers each, the first being the values v_{1}, v_2, ldots , v_ n, and the second the costs c_1, c_2, ldots , c_ n. For the purposes of this problem, all input parameters are positive integers and the sum of all values is at most 2, 000, 000, 000. The sum of all weights is also at most 2, 000, 000, 000. Output For each test case, print the maximum value the loot can have given the cost constraint. Each test case should produce a single line of output. Explanation of Sample Data In the first case, pick items number 2, 3, and 4 for a total weight of 5, and in the second case pick items number 2, 4, 9 for a total weight of 5.
