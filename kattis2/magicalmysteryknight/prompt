A knight’s tour on a rectangular board of n rows and m columns of squares (traditionally 8-by-8) is a labelling of the squares by integers 1 through n cdot m so that label n+1 is a knight’s move from label n. That is, 2 squares horizontally and 1 square vertically or 1 square horizontally and 2 squares vertically. The image below shows an 8-by-8 knight’s tour. A knight’s tour (on a square board) is (semi-)magical if the sum of the values in each row and column is the same (for the 8-by-8 case the sum would be 260). For this problem, you will be given a sequence of semi-magical 8-by-8 knight’s tours with many of the labels removed (see the image below). Write a program to fill in the missing labels so the knight’s tour is semi-magical. Input The input contains a single data set consisting of 8 lines of input. Each line contains 8 integers separated by spaces giving the labels for the corresponding row. If the label value is -1, the label has been removed and your program is to find the correct value to put in that place. There will be at most 45 removed labels with the value -1. You may assume that the starting point of the tour (labeled 1) was not removed and thus appears in the input. Output Output 8 lines containing 8 integers each, separated by spaces, filling in the removed values to give a complete semi-magical knight’s tour which includes the positive labels from the input. There may be multiple correct answers. Your result will be graded correct if it is a semi-magical knight’s tour and the positive labels from the input are in the same square in your answer. Note: Your output does not have to be lined up as shown in the Sample Output. Just make sure that each of the 8 lines of output has at least one space between each value on the line.
