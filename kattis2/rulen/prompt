300 iterations of Rule 90 applied to an initial state where exactly one cell is initially set to 1. Image retrieved from Wikipedia: Rule 90, CC BY-SA 4.0 A cellular automaton is an infinite one-dimensional array of cells. Each cell in the array has one of two states, 0 or 1, but the state of the cell may change over the course of an iterative process. At each iteration, each cell will take on a new state by applying a transition rule that operates on the state of the cell and the state of its two neighbouring cells. The state of a cell and its two neighbours is called a “pattern.” Observe that there are eight possible patterns: 111, 110, 101, 100, 011, 010, 001, and 000. The transition rule is specified by a nonnegative integer, N, less than 256. The indices of the nonzero digits of the 8textrm{-bit} binary representation of N specify which patterns will result in a cell having 1 as its new state after applying the transition rule. Conversely, the indices of the zero digits in the 8textrm{-bit} binary representation of N (including leading zeroes) specify which patterns will result in a cell having 0 as its new state after applying the transition rule. In particular, the least significant digit of the 8textrm{-bit} binary representation of N defines the new state for the pattern 000, the second least significant digit defines the new state for the pattern 001, the third least significant digit defines the new state for the pattern 010, etc. For example, Rule 158 (where 158=10011110_2) has the following transitions. Pattern 111 110 101 100 011 010 001 000 Next State 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 When a transition rule is applied, it is applied to all cells simultaneously and the state changes are instantaneous. Given a rule, N, a number of iterations, R, and the current states of a contiguous section of L cells of a cellular automaton, compute the states of the cells in that section in each of the next R iterations of the transition rule being applied. It is assumed that each of the infinitely many cells in the cellular automaton that are not in the given section are initially in the 0 state. Input The input consists of two lines. The first line consists of three integers, N, L, and R, where 0leq N leq 255, 1leq L leq 100, and 1leq R leq 100. The next line is a sequence of L binary digits giving the initial states of the section of cells in the cellular automaton. Output Output R lines, representing the states of the cells in the given section of the cellular automaton in each of the first R iterations of applying transition rule N.
