We were afraid of making this problem statement too boring, so we decided to keep it short. A sequence is called non-boring if its every connected subsequence contains a unique element, i.e. an element such that no other element of that subsequence has the same value. Given a sequence of integers, decide whether it is non-boring. Input The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T, where 1 le T le 100, 000. The descriptions of the test cases follow: Each test case starts with an integer n (1 leq n leq 200, 000) denoting the length of the sequence. In the next line the n elements of the sequence follow, separated with single spaces. The elements are non-negative integers less than 10^9. The sum of n over all T test cases is at most 1, 500, 000. Output Print the answers to the test cases in the order in which they appear in the input. For each test case print a single line containing the word non-boring or boring.
