To solve this problem, we need to simulate the water flow from the device placement to the nearest points with a lower altitude. We can start by finding the initial water level, which is the negative altitude of the cell where the device is placed. Then, we can perform a BFS (breadth-first search) to simulate the water flow, always moving to the adjacent cell with the lowest altitude until we reach a cell with a higher altitude. We subtract the altitude of the cell from the current water level to get the amount of water drained from that cell. We continue until we have visited all the cells that are covered by water. Finally, we sum up the volumes of all the drained cells to get the total volume of water drained.
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(hw log(hw)), where the log factor comes from the use of a set to keep track of visited cells. The space complexity is also O(hw), since we need to store the altitude map, the BFS queue, and the visited set.
