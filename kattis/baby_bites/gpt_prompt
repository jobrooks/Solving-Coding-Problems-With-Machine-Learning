Arild just turned 1 year old, and is currently learning how to count. His favorite thing to count is how many mouthfuls he has in a meal: every time he gets a bite, he will count it by saying the number out loud.
Unfortunately, talking while having a mouthful sometimes causes Arild to mumble incomprehensibly, making it hard to know how far he has counted. Sometimes you even suspect he loses his count! You decide to write a program to determine whether Arild’s counting makes sense or not.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer n (1<=n<=1000), the number of bites Arild receives. Then second line contains n space-separated words spoken by Arild, the i’th of which is either a non-negative integer a-i (0<=a-i<=10000) or the string "mumble".

Output
If Arild’s counting might make sense, print the string "makes sense". Otherwise, print the string "something is fishy".
