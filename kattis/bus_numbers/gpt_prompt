You are given a list of n integers a1,a2,…,an. A sequence of consecutive integers is called a bus if it has at least two elements. Find all buses such that:

the difference between the largest and smallest element in the bus is exactly k
the buses are pairwise disjoint (i.e. they don't overlap)

Input
The input consists of:

one line with two integers n and k (2≤n≤105, 1≤k≤109) — the length of the list a and the required difference.
one line with n integers a1,a2,…,an (−109≤ai≤109) — the elements of the list a.
Output
If there are no buses, output a single integer 0.

Otherwise, output:

one line with an integer m (the number of buses)
m lines, each containing the number of elements in the corresponding bus and the space-separated elements in non-descending order.

The buses should be sorted in non-descending order of their smallest element. If there are multiple buses with the same smallest element, sort them by their size in non-descending order.
