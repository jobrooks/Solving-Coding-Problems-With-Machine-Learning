You’ve intercepted an encrypted message, and you are really curious about its contents. You know that the message was encrypted using a substitution cipher, in which every letter is replaced with another letter (and the same letter is always replaced with the same letter). In addition:

Only uppercase and lowercase letters are encrypted. Any other characters (like spaces, punctuation, and numbers) are printed as-is in the final message.
The encryption is case-insensitive; meaning that the same letter is either always upper case or always lower case in the encrypted message regardless of its original case in the message before encryption.
You decide to write a program to help you decrypt the message. The program should read a line of text and replace every letter with its corresponding letter as shown in the table below. Non-alphabetic characters should be printed unchanged.

Original: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Substituted: @ 8 ( D 3 F 6 # ! J K 1 M N 0 P Q R $ 7 U V W X Y 2

For example, the message "Hello World!" would become "#3110 87$1!". You also notice that the word "To be, or not to be: that is the question:" decrypts to "7o 83, 06 3o 83: 6#at 6s 8#e 6#e8t6o86:"

Input:
The input consists of a single string s (1≤|s|≤100).

Output:
Print the decrypted message.
