Alice and Bob are playing a game of one-on-one. To keep track of the score, they decided to implement the following system:

Each time a player scores, they gain possession of the ball.
The game starts with possession to Alice.
If Alice scores, she maintains possession of the ball.
If Bob scores, he gains possession of the ball.
The game ends when a player reaches 11 points or more and has a lead of 2 points or more. If a player has a lead of 2 points or more before reaching 11 points, the game also ends.
If the game ends with Alice having a lead of 2 points or more, she wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.
Given a string of uppercase characters 'A' and 'B', representing the sequence of scoring plays, determine who wins the game.

Input:

The input consists of a single line containing a non-empty string s of length at most 100, representing the sequence of scoring plays. Each character of the string is either 'A' or 'B', representing a score by Alice or Bob, respectively. It is guaranteed that the string represents a valid game of one-on-one according to the rules described above.

Output:

Output a single line containing either "A" if Alice wins or "B" if Bob wins.
