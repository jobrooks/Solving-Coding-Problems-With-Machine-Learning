The program reads the input and loops over each test case. For each test case, it calculates the two possible final scores based on the sum and absolute difference of the scores. It then checks if the scores are valid (i.e. non-negative integers and their sum and absolute difference match the input). If the scores are valid, it prints them in descending order. Otherwise, it prints "impossible".
