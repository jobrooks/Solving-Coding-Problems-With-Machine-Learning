Solve in Python and justify:
When you compute a large, factorial number, it has a long string of low-order zeros at the end. This makes sense; every time you multiply in something like a 10 or a 20, you are sure to pick up another low-order zero. Thus, it’s easy to guess the low-order digit of something like 3249!. It’s a little harder to guess what the lowest-order non-zero digit will be. Write a program to do that.

Input
Input consists of up to 1000 test cases, one per line. Each test case is a single positive integer i<= 10^6. Input ends with a value of zero.

Output
For each test case, print out the value of the rightmost (lowest-order) non-zero digit of i!.
