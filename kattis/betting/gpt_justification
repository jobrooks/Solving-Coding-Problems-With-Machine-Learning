Explanation:

We first read the percentage of switch points bet on option one from the input.
Then, we compute the switch-payout-ratio for option one by dividing the percentage of switch points bet on option two by the percentage of switch points bet on option one.
We compute the switch-payout-ratio for option two by dividing the percentage of switch points bet on option one by the percentage of switch points bet on option two.
Finally, we print the ratios for both options with 3 decimal places using f-strings.
