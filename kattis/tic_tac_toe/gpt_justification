To solve this problem, we need to check whether a given grid could be part of a valid Tic Tac Toe game. There are two possible outcomes:

The given grid is valid and could be part of a valid Tic Tac Toe game.
The given grid is invalid and could not be part of a valid Tic Tac Toe game.
To determine whether a given grid is valid, we need to check the following conditions:

The number of X's is either equal to the number of O's or one more than the number of O's.
If X has won, then the number of X's is one more than the number of O's.
If O has won, then the number of X's is equal to the number of O's.
If these conditions are met, then the given grid is valid and could be part of a valid Tic Tac Toe game.

Otherwise, the given grid is invalid and could not be part of a valid Tic Tac Toe game.
The is_valid_grid function takes a grid as input and returns True if the grid is valid and False otherwise. We check whether the number of X's and O's satisfy the conditions mentioned above. If they do, we check whether X has won or O has won, and we also check that the number of X's and O's satisfy the conditions mentioned above. If everything checks out, we return True. Otherwise, we return False.

Note that the above code assumes that the input grid is a list of lists of characters, where each character is either 'X', 'O', or '.'. You may need to modify the code slightly to handle input in a different format.
