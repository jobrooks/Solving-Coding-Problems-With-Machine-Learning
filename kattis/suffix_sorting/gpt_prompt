Input
The input consists of less than 10 test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing a non-empty string s, of length at most 100000. Then follows a line containing an integer n followed by n integers q_1, \ldots , q_ n, where 0 <= q_i, each indicating a query.

Output
For each test case, output a line containing n integers p_{1}, \ldots , p_{n}, where p_i is the starting position of the q_iâ€™th smallest suffix of s.
