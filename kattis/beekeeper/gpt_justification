The program reads in multiple test cases until a line with a single zero is encountered. For each test case, it reads in the number of words N and the N words themselves. It then loops through the words, counting the number of pairs of double vowels in each word, and keeping track of the word with the most double vowels seen so far. Finally, it prints the word with the most double vowels for the current test case.

The program uses two variables, max_word and max_count, to keep track of the word with the most double vowels seen so far and the number of double vowels in that word. It initializes both variables to empty strings and zero, respectively, before the loop. For each word, it counts the number of pairs of double vowels by looping through the word and checking if each vowel is the same as the following vowel. If the count for the current word is greater than max_count, the program updates max_word and max_count to the current word and count, respectively. Finally, it prints max_word for the current test case.
