To solve this problem in Python, we can use a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 0 to node n-1 in the forest graph.

Define a function shortest_path that takes two integers n and k as input and returns the length of the shortest path from node 0 to node n-1 in the forest graph.

Initialize a priority queue pq with the starting node 0 and a distance of 0.

Initialize a list dist with n elements, where dist[i] represents the shortest distance from node 0 to node i. Set all elements to infinity except for dist[0], which is set to 0.

While pq is not empty, pop the node u with the smallest distance from pq. For each neighbor v of u, compute the distance from u to v and add it to the distance from the starting node to u. If this distance is less than the current shortest distance to v, update dist[v] and add v to pq with the new distance.

Return dist[n-1], which represents the shortest distance from node 0 to node n-1.
To justify the correctness of the code, we can consider the following:

The modified Dijkstra's algorithm correctly finds the shortest path from node 0 to node n-1 in the forest graph. It maintains a priority queue of nodes to visit, and updates the shortest distances to the nodes as it visits them. The algorithm terminates when it reaches the destination node, and returns the shortest distance to it.

The loop that generates the neighbors of a node u takes into account the two types of edges in the forest graph: the edges from u to u+1, and the edges from u to the multiples of k. It generates the neighbors by adding 1 to u and by iterating over the multiples of k that are greater than u and less than n. It skips u itself as a neighbor, since it is not considered a multiple of k.

The input is read correctly, and the output is the shortest path from node 0 to node n-1. This ensures that the program solves the problem as stated.

Therefore, we can conclude that the Python
