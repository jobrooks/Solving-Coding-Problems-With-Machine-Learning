Solve in Python and Justify
Input
Input contains several test cases. Each test case begins with an integer 
n (1<= n <= 1000). Then follow a list of n points, one per line, each of the form x y. Coordinates are integer with absolute value bounded by 10000. The given points are all distinct. The input is terminated by a case beginning with 0.

Output
For each test case, output the maximum number of simultaneously colinear points in the given set of points.
