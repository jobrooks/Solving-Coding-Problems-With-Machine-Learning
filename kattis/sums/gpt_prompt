solve in python and justify:
Given an integer N, express it as the sum of at least two consecutive positive integers. For example:
10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
24 = 7 + 8 + 9


If there are multiple solutions, output the one with the smallest possible number of summands.

Input
The first line of input contains the number of test cases T (1 \leq T \leq 2000). The descriptions of the test cases follow:

Each test case consists of one line containing an integer N (1 \leq N \leq 10^9).

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the equation in the format N = a +(a+1) + \ldots + b as in the example. If there is no solution, output a single word IMPOSSIBLE instead.

Sample Input 1
3
8
10
24
Sample Output 1
IMPOSSIBLE
10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
24 = 7 + 8 + 9
