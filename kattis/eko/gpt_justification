To solve this problem, we can use binary search to find the maximum height H that allows Mirko to cut off at least M metres of wood.

First, we can compute an array of the amount of wood that Mirko can get for each possible height H, by iterating through the trees and summing up the amount of wood cut off for each tree using the formula max(0, height[i]-H). Then we can use binary search to find the maximum height H that allows Mirko to cut off at least M metres of wood. We can start with the lowest possible height, which is 0, and the highest possible height, which is the maximum height of the trees. At each step, we compute the total amount of wood that Mirko can get for the midpoint height, and compare it with M. If it is greater than or equal to M, we update the lower bound to the midpoint height. Otherwise, we update the upper bound to the midpoint height. We continue until the lower and upper bounds are adjacent.

The can_cut_trees function computes the total amount of wood that Mirko can get for a given height H, by iterating through the trees and summing up the amount of wood cut off for each tree using the formula max(0, height[i]-H). The can_cut_trees function returns True if the total amount of wood is greater than or equal to M, and False otherwise.

The binary search loop starts with the lowest possible height, which is 0, and the highest possible height, which is the maximum height of the trees. At each step, it computes the midpoint height using integer division ((lo + hi + 1) // 2). If the total amount of wood that Mirko can get for the midpoint height is greater than or equal to M, it updates the lower bound lo to the midpoint height. Otherwise, it updates the upper bound hi to the midpoint height minus one. The loop continues until the lower and upper bounds are adjacent (i.e., lo == hi).

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N log H), where N is the number of trees and H is the maximum height of the trees. The space complexity is O(1), since we only need to store the input values and a few variables.
