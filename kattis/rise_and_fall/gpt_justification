The find_rising_falling() function takes an integer n and returns the largest number less than or equal to n that rises and falls. It does this by first converting n to a list of digits, then finding the index i such that digits[i] > digits[i+1] (if any). If no such index is found, n is already a rising and falling number and can be returned immediately. Otherwise, it finds the index j such that digits[j] < digits[j-1], starting from the end of the list, and swaps digits[i] and digits[j]. Finally, it reverses the digits after index i and converts the list of digits back to an integer.
