Input
The first line of input consists of two integers N and Q, where 1<= N <= 1000000 is the number of elements in the base set and 0 <= Q <= 1000000 is the number of operations. Then follow Q lines, one per operation. There are two types of operations:
"= a b" indicate that the sets containing a and b are joined

"? a b" is a query asking whether a and b belong to the same set

In both cases, a and b are distinct integers between 0 and N - 1.

Output
For each query output a line containing "yes" if a and b are in the same set, and "no" otherwise.
