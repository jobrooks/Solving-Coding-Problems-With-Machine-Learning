The code reads in the coordinates of the first three points from standard input using the input() function. It then checks which of the three points has the same x-coordinate as another point and which has the same y-coordinate as another point. The fourth point will have the same x-coordinate as the point with the same x-coordinate as another point and the same y-coordinate as the point with the same y-coordinate as another point. Finally, the code outputs the coordinates of the fourth point using the print() function.
