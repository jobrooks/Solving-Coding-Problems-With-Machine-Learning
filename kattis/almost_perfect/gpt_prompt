A positive integer p is called a perfect number if all the proper divisors of p sum to p exactly. Integer d is a proper divisor of p if 1<=d<=p-1 and p is evenly divisible by d. For example, the number 28 is a perfect number, since its proper divisors (which are 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14) add up to 28.

Perfect numbers are rare; only 50 of them are known (as of 2017). Perhaps the definition of perfection is a little too strict. Instead, we will consider numbers that weâ€™ll call almost perfect. Positive integer p is almost perfect if the proper divisors of p sum to a value that differs from p by no more than two.

Input
Input consists of a sequence of up to 500 integers, one per line. Each integer is in the range 2 to 10^9 (inclusive). Input ends at end of file.

Output
For each input value, output the same value and then one of the following: "perfect" (if the number is perfect), "almost perfect" (if it is almost perfect but not perfect), or "not perfect" (otherwise).
