Input
Input contains several test cases, one per line. Each test case consists of an expression to be evaluated, containing numbers, parentheses, and the operators +, -, *, /.

Normal operator precedence applies, so multiplication and division bind harder than addition and subtraction. All operators evaluate left-to-right. Implicit multiplication is not possible, so 3(1+1) is not a valid input. There may be an arbitrary amount (including 0) of spaces between tokens. Numbers are integers with absolute value at most 500.

Input is terminated by end of file.

Output
For each test case, output the value of the expression, with two digits of precision after the decimal point.
