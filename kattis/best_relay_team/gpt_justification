The code reads the input, which consists of n lines, each describing a runner with their name and the times for the two legs. The main loop then tries all possible combinations of runners for the four legs, calculates the total time for each team, and keeps track of the best team found so far. Finally, the code outputs the best time and the names of the runners in that team.

Note that the code assumes that there are at least four runners in the input, and that the times for each runner satisfy the given constraints. It also assumes that there are no ties for the best time, which is a reasonable assumption given the precision of the input.
