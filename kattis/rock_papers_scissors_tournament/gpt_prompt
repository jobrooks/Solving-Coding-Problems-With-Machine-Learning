Rock-Paper-Scissors is game for two players, A and B, who each choose, independently of the other, one of rock, paper, or scissors. A player chosing paper wins over a player chosing rock; a player chosing scissors wins over a player chosing paper; a player chosing rock wins over a player chosing scissors. A player chosing the same thing as the other player neither wins nor loses.

A tournament has been organized in which each of n players plays k rock-scissors-paper games with each of the other players, so there are kn(n-1).2 games in total. Your job is to compute the win average for each player, defined as w/(w+l) where w is the number of games won, and l is the number of games lost, by the player.

Input
Input consists of several test cases. The first line of input for each case contains 1\leq n \leq 100, 1 \leq k \leq 100 as defined above. For each game, a line follows containing p_1, m_1, p_2, m_2. 1 \leq p_1 \leq n  and 1 \leq p_2 \leq n are distinct integers identifying two players; m_1 and m_2 are their respective moves ("rock", "scissors", or "paper"). A line containing 0 follows the last test case.

Output
Output one line each for player 1, player 2, and so on, through player n, giving the playerâ€™s win average rounded to three decimal places. If the win average is undefined, output "-". Output an empty line between cases.
