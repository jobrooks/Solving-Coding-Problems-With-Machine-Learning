Given a bracket sequence s of length n, you are to determine if it is valid!

A valid bracket sequence is defined recursively as:

""
(x) where x is a valid bracket sequence
[x] where x is a valid bracket sequence
{x} where x is a valid bracket sequence
xy, where x and y are valid bracket sequences

Input
The first line of each contains one integer n (2<=n<=100 000) — the length of the bracket sequence.

The second line of each test case contains a string s — the bracket sequence in the question. It is guaranteed that s only contains () [] {} as characters.

Output
Output a single integer — the answer to the problem.
