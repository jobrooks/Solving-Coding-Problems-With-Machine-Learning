Approach:

Create a list of tuples with start and end range of cameras
Sort the list based on the start range of each camera.
Then iterate through the list and merge overlapping ranges.
For each non-overlapping range, increment the count of cameras required.
Time complexity: O(k log k) (sorting the camera ranges).
