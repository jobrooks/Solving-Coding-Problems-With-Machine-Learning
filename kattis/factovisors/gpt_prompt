solve in python and justify:
The factorial function, n! is defined thus for n!
 a non-negative integer:
n! = \begin{cases}1 & \text {if $n = 0$} \\ n \cdot (n-1)! & \text {if $n > 0$} \end{cases}
 
We say that a divides b if there exists an integer k such that k * a = b.

Input
The input to your program consists of several lines, each containing two non-negative integers, n and m, both less than 2^{31}.

Output
For each input line, output a line stating whether or not m divides n!, in the format shown below.

Sample Input 1	
6 9
6 27
20 10000
20 100000
1000 1009
Sample Output 1
9 divides 6!
27 does not divide 6!
10000 divides 20!
100000 does not divide 20!
1009 does not divide 1000!
