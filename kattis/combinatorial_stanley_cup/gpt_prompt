Combinatorial Stanley Cup
You have always dreamt to get your name on the Stanley Cup, but you have never played hockey. A friend of yours heard of an alternative: the Combinatorial Stanley Cup! If you solve a single programming problem, you will get your name on this purely fictional trophy. What an opportunity!

The problem is simple: for a given N, find the number of odd coefficients in the binomial (1+x)^N. Oh! Thereâ€™s a catch: N can be as big as 2 billions!

Input
The only line in the input is an integer 0<=N<=2 000 000 000, the degree of the binomial (1+x)^N for which you need to determine how many of its coefficients are odd.
