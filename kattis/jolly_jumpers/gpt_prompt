Solve in python and justify:
A sequence of n > 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the absolute values of the difference between successive elements take on all the values 1 through n-1. For instance,
1 4 2 3
is a jolly jumper, because the absolutes differences are 3, 2, and 1 respectively. The definition implies that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper. You are to write a program to determine whether or not each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper.

Input
Each line of input contains an integer n <= 3000 followed by n integers representing the sequence. The values in the sequence are at most 300000 in absolute value. Input contains at most 10 lines.

Output
For each line of input, generate a line of output saying "Jolly" or "Not jolly".

Sample Input 1
4 1 4 2 3
5 1 4 2 -1 6
Sample Output 1
Jolly
Not jolly
