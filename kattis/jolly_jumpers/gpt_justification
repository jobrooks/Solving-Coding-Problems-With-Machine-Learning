To solve this problem in Python, we can follow these steps:

Parse the input to obtain the sequence of integers.
Compute the absolute differences between successive elements in the sequence.
Check if all the values 1 through n-1 appear in the absolute differences.
If all the values appear, output "Jolly"; otherwise, output "Not jolly".
Let's go over the code in more detail:

We use sys.stdin to read the input lines. The for loop iterates over the lines, one at a time.
We extract the sequence of integers from the line using split() and map(). We use list slicing to exclude the first integer, which represents the length of the sequence.
We compute the absolute differences between successive elements using a list comprehension. We use the abs() function to compute the absolute value of the difference.
We create a set of the expected absolute differences using range() and set(). We expect the differences to be 1 through n-1, where n is the length of the sequence.
We check if the set of computed absolute differences is equal to the set of expected absolute differences using the == operator. If they are equal, we output "Jolly"; otherwise, we output "Not jolly".

The program reads from standard input and writes to standard output, so you can run it from the command line like this:
$ python jolly_jumper.py < input.txt
Where input.txt is a file containing the input data. The output will be printed to the console.

Note that the program assumes that the input is well-formed, with one line per test case, and with valid integers in each line. It also assumes that the input contains at most 10 lines, as stated in the problem description.
