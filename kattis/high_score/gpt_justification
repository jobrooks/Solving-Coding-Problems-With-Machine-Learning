Explanation:

We first read in the number of players n and loop through each player. For each player, we read in the number of Cog, Tablet, Compass, and Wildcard Science tokens.

We calculate the score for the player's starting distribution of tokens, which is given by a*a + b*b + c*c + 7*min(a, b, c).

If the player has any Wildcard Science tokens (d > 0), we consider all possible ways of distributing them among the three types of tokens. We create a temporary tuple temp representing the new distribution of tokens and calculate the score using the formula above. We append the score to a list of scores.

Finally, we output the maximum score for the player by taking the maximum value in the list of scores.

Note that we only need to consider three possible distributions of the wildcard tokens, since any other distribution can be obtained by permuting the types of tokens.
