Nicholas Neverson was a student at Northlings Neverland Academy. As with any daydreaming student, Nicholas was playing around with a Kaleidoscope one day instead of paying attention to the teacher. Since this was math class, his daydreams quickly turned to palindromic numbers. A palindromic number is any number which reads the same forwards and backwards.

He describes his vision to you at lunch: numbers which are palindromic in several bases at once. Nicholas wonders how many such numbers exist. You decide you can quickly code up a program that given a range and a number k, outputs the number of numbers palindromic in all bases j, 2<=j<=k, in that range.

Input
Input consists of three space-separated integers: a,b, and k. The input satisfies the following constraints:
0<= a<= b<= 2000000, 2<=k<=100000.
Output
Output the quantity of numbers between a and b inclusive which are palindromes in every base k, for 2<= j <=k.

Sample Input 1:
1 356 2
Sample Output 1:
36
Sample Input 2:
18 118 13
Sample Output 2: 
0
