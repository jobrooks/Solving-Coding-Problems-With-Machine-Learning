To solve this problem, we need to first count the number of connected components in the graph. This can be done using a depth-first search or a breadth-first search.

For each destination ticket, we check if the two cities on the ticket are in the same connected component. If they are, then we can travel from one city to the other using the claimed rail segments, and the ticket can be completed. If they are not in the same connected component, then we cannot complete the ticket.

We count the number of valid tickets (i.e., tickets that can be completed) and divide it by the total number of possible tickets (which is n*(n-1)/2, where n is the number of cities). The resulting fraction gives us the probability of earning points from the ticket.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m + n^2), which is efficient enough for the given input constraints.
