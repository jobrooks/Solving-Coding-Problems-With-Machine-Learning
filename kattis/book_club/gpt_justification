To solve this problem, we need to find cycles of size three or more, where each member in the cycle likes the book of the next member in the cycle. If we can find such cycles that cover all members of the book club, then the answer is YES, otherwise, the answer is NO.

We can solve this problem using graph theory. We can create a directed graph where each node represents a member of the book club, and there is a directed edge from node A to node B if A likes the book of B. Then, we need to find cycles in this graph that cover all nodes.

One way to find cycles that cover all nodes is to use the concept of strongly connected components. A strongly connected component (SCC) is a subset of nodes in a directed graph such that for any two nodes in the subset, there is a directed path from one node to the other. In other words, a strongly connected component is a cycle or a group of cycles that are interconnected.

To find SCCs, we can use the algorithm called Kosaraju's algorithm. This algorithm consists of two passes of depth-first search (DFS) on the graph. In the first pass, we visit each node of the graph and mark it as visited. In the second pass, we visit the nodes in reverse order of their finish times (i.e., the time at which the DFS traversal of each node ends in the first pass). In each second-pass traversal, we mark all nodes visited by that traversal as belonging to the same SCC.

After we have found all SCCs, we can check if there is an SCC that contains all nodes in the graph. If there is such an SCC, then we can form a cycle that covers all nodes by traversing the SCC in any order. If there is no such SCC, then it is impossible to find cycles that cover all nodes, and the answer is NO.
