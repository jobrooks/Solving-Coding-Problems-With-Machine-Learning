The program reads the input one day at a time, and for each day it creates a dictionary menu to keep track of who ordered each item. It then processes each order and adds the corresponding person to the set of customers who ordered that item. Finally, it prints out the report for the day, sorting the menu items and the names lexicographically. It also prints a blank line at the end of the report to separate it from the next day's report.
