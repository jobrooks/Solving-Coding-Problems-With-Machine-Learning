Bob might ask for a\\n    $10000$ ounce coffee\\n    (meaning binary) and Alice might make misinterpret his request\\n    as being in decimal and give him a $10011100010000$ ounce coffee\\n    (binary). After Sue explains that this much coffee costs\\n    $100$ dollars (decimal),\\n    Bob might assume he only has to pay $4$ dollars (interpreting the price as\\n    being in binary). In response to these differences that are\\n    difficult to resolve, these two groups have divided the world\\n    into two regions, the binary-friendly zones and the\\n    decimal-friendly zones.

By instructing the squad to execute different\\n    cheers, she can raise or lower this level; for example, less\\n    lively cheers temper the level of enthusiasm, while other, more\\n    exciting cheers raise it.\\nAt the beginning, the crowd’s level of enthusiasm is zero.\\n    To prime the crowd for the second half of the game, she wants\\n    the level of enthusiasm after all the cheers to be exactly $T$.\\n    Note that it is possible for the crowd’s level of enthusiasm to\\n    dip below zero or exceed $T$ in between the cheers.\\nThere are $N+1$ cheers\\n    at Rainbow Dash’s disposal. The $i^\\\\text {th}$ of these cheers changes\\n    the level of enthusiasm by $S_\\n    i$, and has a level of difficulty $D_ i$—a higher difficulty requires\\n    more practice and is harder to execute correctly. The first of\\n    these cheers is always a standard cheer with $S_1 = 1$ and $D_1 = 1$; the other $N$ non-standard cheers are possibly\\n    more complicated.\\nHelp Rainbow Dash plan out a sequence of cheers such that\\n    the crowd’s level of enthusiasm after all the cheers is exactly\\n    $T$. Note that the same\\n    cheer can be executed multiple times, and the order of the\\n    cheers can be rearranged as necessary; moreover, the existence\\n    of the standard cheer ensures that this goal is always\\n    attainable.\\nAmong all such sequences, she wants the total level of\\n    difficulty to be minimized in order to reduce the amount of\\n    practice the squad will need—time is of the essence and we need\\n    to make the most use of it.

The computer would then\\n    compare the password to the password on disk. If the comparison\\n    failed, it would deny access, if it succeeded, access would be\\n    allowed. Researchers at MIT were quick to discover several\\n    security flaws in this password system. We will explore one of\\n    them, the timing attack.\\n    In a timing attack, we exploit that we can deduce a\\n    computation path from the time it takes to do the computation.\\n    In CTSS the password check was done using a simple string\\n    matching algorithm, similar to this:\\n\\nbool CheckPassword(string pwd1, string pwd2) {\\n    if (pwd1.Length != pwd2.Length) {\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n    for (int i = 0; i < pwd1.Length; i++) {\\n        if (pwd1[i] != pwd2[i]) {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return true;\\n}\\n\\nFor the purpose of this problem, we will use a (very)\\n    simplified timing model and the above algorithm. The timing\\n    model looks as follows:\\n\\n\\nA branching statement (if or for) takes $1$ ms.\\n\\n\\nAn assignment, or update of a memory address takes\\n        $1$ ms.\\n\\n\\nA comparison between two memory addresses takes\\n        $3$ ms.\\n\\n\\nA return statement takes $1$ ms.\\n\\n\\nThe password consists of between $1$ and $20$ English letters, upper or lower\\n    case, and digits.\\nInteraction\\nThis is an interactive problem. Your submission will be run\\n    against an interactor, which reads the standard output\\n    of your submission and writes to the standard input of your\\n    submission. This interaction needs to follow a specific\\n    protocol:\\n\\n\\nYour program first sends a password string, consisting\\n        of between $1$ and\\n        $20$ English letters,\\n        upper or lower case, and digits.\\n\\n\\nDepending on if the password is correct, the interactor\\n        then responds with either:\\n\\n\\nIf the password is correct; “ACCESS GRANTED”. Your program should\\n            then exit cleanly.\\n\\n\\nIf the password is incorrect; “ACCESS DENIED ($t$ ms)”, where\\n            $t$ is the time it\\n            took to verify the password in ms.

The rules of lacing are as follows:\\n\\n\\nThe resulting lacing pattern must be symmetric across a\\n        line drawn vertically between the even-numbered and\\n        odd-numbered eyelets.\\n\\n\\nThe lace can only pass through an eyelet at most\\n        once.\\n\\n\\nThe lace can only pass between eyelets in the same\\n        column that are immediately adjacent.\\n\\n\\nThe free ends of the lace must emerge from eyelet\\n        numbers $2N - 2$ and\\n        $2N - 1$.\\n\\n\\nThe lace must pass directly between eyelet numbers 0 and\\n        1 to ensure the shoelace holds the shoe on the foot.\\n\\n\\nYou are to assume that the surface the eyelets are on is to\\n    be treated as a plane, that the shoelace passes through the\\n    center of the eyelets, and that the thickness of the shoelace\\n    itself is negligible. The total length of the shoelace that is\\n    used for lacing is the length used between the eyelets plus\\n    $t$ for each eyelet the\\n    shoelace passes through. In the example shown in Figure 2,\\n    $6t$ of the shoelace\\n    length is used by passing through the six eyelets.\\nInput\\nThe input begins with a single line containing $N, d, s, t, f_{min}, f_{max}$,\\n    separated by whitespace. Each additional line is a new value of\\n    $L$ for which your program\\n    is to count the number of lacing patterns that meet the stated\\n    requirements. There will be between $1$ and $100$ values of $L$. All measurements are in integer\\n    millimeters.\\n$N$ will be between\\n    $2$ and $9$ inclusive. $d$ will be between $5$ and $30$ inclusive. $s$ will be between $10$ and $50$ inclusive. $t$ will be between $0$ and $4$ inclusive. $f_{min}$ and $f_{max}$ satisfy $0 \\\\leq f_{min} \\\\leq f_{max} \\\\leq 2\\\\,\\n    000$.

Each query can be one of\\n    the following $2$\\n    types:\\n\\n\\nLinux puts exactly one stone inside exactly one box\\n        between $u$-th box and\\n        $v$-th box, inclusive,\\n        with equal probability. $(1\\n        \\\\le u \\\\le v \\\\le N)$.\\n\\n\\nLet $a_ i$ be the\\n        number of stones in black box numbered $i$. Let $A = \\\\sum _{i=1}^{N}{a_ i^2}$.\\n        Bash has to calculate the expected value $E(A)$.\\n\\n\\nBash can only drop out of his university if he is able to\\n    answer all queries correctly. But now all Bash can think of is\\n    Pokenom. Please help him!\\nInput\\nThe first line of input contains exactly $2$ positive integers $N$ and $Q$. $(1\\n    \\\\le N, Q \\\\le 10^5)$.\\n$Q$ lines follow, each\\n    line contains exactly one query. As explained, a query can be\\n    one of the following $2$\\n    types:\\n\\n\\n$1 \\\\; u \\\\; v$:\\n        Linux puts a stone inside one of the boxes between\\n        $u$ and $v$.\\n\\n\\n$2$: Linux asks\\n        Bash to compute $E(A)$.\\n\\n\\nOutput\\nIt can be proved that the expected value can be represented\\n    as an irreducible fraction $\\\\dfrac {A}{B}$. For each query of\\n    type $2$, print one line\\n    containing the value $A \\\\times\\n    B^{-1}$ modulo $10^{9} +\\n    7$. The given input guarantees that $B$ is not a multiple of $10^{9} + 7$.\\nExplanation for examples\\n\\n\\nIn the first example: With a probability of $0.5$, two stones are in different\\n        squares. Hence, the answer to the fourth query is\\n        $0.5 \\\\times (1^{2} + 1^{2}) +\\n        0.5 \\\\times 2^{2} = 3$.\\n\\n\\nIn the second example: With a probability of\\n        $\\\\frac{2}{3}$, two\\n        stones are in different squares. Hence, the answer to the\\n        fourth query is $\\\\frac{2}{3}\\n        \\\\times 2 + \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times 4 = \\\\frac{8}{3}$.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Input 1\\nSample Output 1\\n\\n\\n\\n2 4\\n1 1 2\\n2\\n1 1 2\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Input 2\\nSample Output 2\\n\\n\\n\\n3 4\\n1 1 3\\n2\\n1 1 3\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n666666674',\n",

Unfortunately, flights are often very late.\\n    This is especially problematic when taking a connecting flight.\\n    As it happens, Jonna just landed at Copenhagen Airport,\\n    trying to make her connection to Heathrow Airport. Since her\\n    flight from Helsinki was delayed, she must walk very quickly\\n    from her arrival gate to the new departure gate. Normally,\\n    Jonna walks at a speed of $a$ centimeters per second. To make\\n    matters more difficult, Jonna has a slight coffee addiction,\\n    and will walk very sluggishly while not drinking coffee. While\\n    the coffee itself does not really affect the walking speed, the\\n    resulting grumpiness from not drinking coffee trumps even the\\n    worries of a missed flight. When she is drinking coffee, her\\n    speed increases to $b$\\n    centimeters per second.\\nThe distance between Jonna’s arrival and departure gates is\\n    $\\\\ell $ centimeters, and\\n    along the way there are $n$ small coffee carts where Jonna can\\n    buy a cup of coffee. When buying a cup of coffee (a practically\\n    instant endeavour nowadays, thanks to contactless card\\n    payments), she first waits for $t$ seconds, in order to let it cool\\n    down. During this time, she will keep walking at the slower\\n    pace. Immediately after $t$ seconds pass, she starts drinking\\n    the coffee. It takes exactly $r$ seconds to finish the coffee\\n    (during which she walks at the faster pace). When the coffee is\\n    finished, she will again walk slower.\\nNote that Jonna is carrying a bag with her left hand, so she\\n    can only carry a single cup of coffee at a time. While a bit\\n    wasteful, she may throw away a cup that still contains some\\n    amount of coffee to purchase a brand new cup.\\nCan you help Jonna determine where to purchase her\\n    coffee(s), in order to get to her departure gate as quickly as\\n    possible?\\nInput\\nThe first line of input contains five integers $\\\\ell $, $a$, $b$, $t$ and $r$, where:\\n\\n\\n$1 \\\\le \\\\ell \\\\le\\n        10^{11}$ is the distance between Jonna’s arrival and\\n        departure gates in centimeters.\\n\\n\\n$1 \\\\le a < b \\\\le\\n        200$ are Jonna’s walking speeds in centimeters per\\n        second when she is not and when she is drinking coffee,\\n        respectively.\\n\\n\\n$0 \\\\le t \\\\le 300$\\n        is the number of seconds Jonna must wait until she can\\n        drink her coffee.\\n\\n\\n$1 \\\\le r \\\\le 1200$\\n        is the number of seconds it takes for Jonna to drink a cup\\n        of coffee.\\n\\n\\nThen follows a line containing an integer $0 \\\\le n \\\\le 500\\\\, 000$, the number of\\n    coffee carts between the two gates.

Next, output a single line\\n    containing the indices of the coffee carts where Jonna should\\n    buy coffee. These indicies should be between $0$ and $n - 1$, and correspond to the order\\n    of the coffee carts in the input. The indices may be output in\\n    any order, but each index must be output at most once.\\nYour answer will be accepted if the time that the proposed\\n    coffee purchasing plan takes is within an absolute or relative\\n    error of at most $10^{-9}$\\n    compared to the optimum time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Illustration of Sample Input 1 and a\\n          possible solution.

By activating certain\\n    configurations in the correct order, more powerful\\n    transmutations can be produced. Activating circles incorrectly\\n    can have drastic effects on the alchemist’s body.\\nA young alchemist named Nicholas Flamel would like to learn\\n    the ways of alchemy. He is going to draw several configurations\\n    of transmutation circles on the ground. When a circle is drawn\\n    it burns bright red representing the element of fire. The\\n    drawing of the circle itself produces no energy, but it has an\\n    effect on any and all circles that are already drawn inside!\\n    All of the circles inside the newly drawn circle quickly change\\n    to their complement elements. Fire changes to a cool blue\\n    representing water. Circles that were blue for water will burn\\n    fiery red once again. This transformation can either create or\\n    drain energy.

To give you\\n    an idea, we will describe a simplified version of such\\n    rules.\\nThe game consists of rounds. In each round, a player rolls\\n    five dice. After the first roll, it is possible to keep some of\\n    the dice and re-roll the rest of them. Any number of dice can\\n    be rerolled (including none or all of them).

During the whole game, each\\n    combination must be used exactly once. It may happen that some\\n    result would not fit into any available combination. In such a\\n    case, the player must select some combination anyway, scoring\\n    zero points for that round and losing the possibility to use\\n    that combination later. These rules make the game very tricky,\\n    especially at the end, when the combinations have been almost\\n    exhausted.\\nNow, we get back to Isaac.

If you write a program that would help him to become\\n    rich, he may share some of his money with you.\\nInput\\nThe input contains several scenarios (at most 12), each of\\n    them specified on a single line. The line contains three\\n    numbers separated by a space: $A$, $C$, and $X_0$. These numbers describe the\\n    random-number generator: $A$ is called a multiplier\\n$(1\\\\leq A\\\\leq 2^{31})$,\\n    $C$ is an\\n    increment $(0\\\\leq C\\\\leq\\n    2^{31})$, and $X_0$\\n    is the initial seed $(0\\\\leq X_0\\\\leq 2^{31})$. The last\\n    scenario is followed by a line containing three zeros.\\nThe generator is a linear congruential generator, which\\n    means that the next random number is calculated from the\\n    previous one using the following formula:\\\\[ X_{n+1} = (A\\\\cdot X_ n + C) \\\\bmod 2^{32}\\n    \\\\]\\nThe modulo operation specifies that only the lowest 32 bits\\n    of the result are used, the rest is discarded. Numbers\\n    $X_1, X_2, X_3, \\\\ldots $\\n    constitute a pseudo-random sequence, each of them determines\\n    the result of one individual roll of a dice. With congruential\\n    generators, the “randomness” of the numbers is in their higher\\n    bits only – therefore, to get a result of the $n$-th roll (starting with\\n    $n = 1$), we discard lower\\n    16 bits of the number $X_\\n    n$ and compute the remainder when the number in bits\\n    16–31 is divided by six. This gives a number between 0 and 5,\\n    by adding one, we get a number shown on a dice:\\\\[ roll(n) = (\\\\lfloor X_ n/2^{16}\\\\rfloor\\n    \\\\bmod 6) + 1 \\\\]\\nFor example, when $A = 69069,\\n    C = 5,$ and the $X_0 =\\n    0$ is zero, we get the following sequence of “random”\\n    rolls: $1, 6, 6, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2,\\n    3, 5, 1, 6, 6, 4, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, \\\\ldots $.\\nOutput\\nFor each scenario, print one integer number: the maximal\\n    number of points that may be scored in a game determined by the\\n    given generator.

For example, we interpret the number $72345$ as:\\\\[ 7 \\\\times 10^4 + 2 \\\\times 10^3 + 3 \\\\times\\n    10^2 + 4 \\\\times 10^1 + 5 \\\\times 10^0. \\\\]\\nThis example illustrates that in base $10$ the symbol at place $P\\\\ge 0$ (starting from the right) is\\n    multiplied by $10^ P$ to\\n    get its value. More generally, in base $B$ we use $B$ symbols to represent $0, \\\\ldots , B-1$, and the symbol at\\n    the $P$th place is\\n    multiplied by $B^ P$ to\\n    get its value.\\nOther bases commonly used in computation include base\\n    $2$ (or binary, using\\n    symbols $0$ and\\n    $1$), base $8$ (or octal, using symbols\\n    $0$–$7$), and base $16$ (or hexadecimal, using symbols\\n    $0$–$9$ and $a$–$f$). In bases higher than\\n    $10$, letters represent\\n    the higher values. Thus in hexadecimal $a$–$f$ represent the decimal values\\n    $10$–$15$, and in bases $\\\\ge 36$ the letter $z$ represents the decimal value\\n    $35$.\\nYour job is to determine the bases in which given arithmetic\\n    expressions are valid. We define an expression as\\n    valid in base $B$\\n    if two conditions are true. First, all the operands used are\\n    interpretable in base $B$\\n    as having values in the decimal range $[1,2^{32}-1]$. Second, the expression\\n    is true. Any arbitrary expression might be valid in zero, one,\\n    or more bases. In this problem we will only consider bases\\n    $1$–$36$, where base $1$ is unary.\\nNote that following the convention listed above, unary would\\n    consist of a single symbol: $0$. In this problem, unary numbers\\n    use the symbol $1$ rather\\n    than $0$ (think “tally\\n    marks”). E.g., $111$ in\\n    unary is equivalent to the decimal number $3$ and $1111111$ in unary is equivalent to\\n    the decimal number $7$.\\nInput\\nInput for this problem starts with a line containing an\\n    integer $0\\\\le N \\\\le 20$.\\n    The following $N$ lines\\n    each contain an arithmetic expression with the following\\n    form:\\\\[ X ~ op ~ Y ~ = ~ Z\\n    \\\\]\\nwhere $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are positive, whole numbers\\n    consisting of $1$ to\\n    $100$ symbols from the set\\n    $0$–$9$ and $a$–$z$, and $op$ is one of the four operators\\n    +, -, *, /.

The\\n    values $r$ and\\n    $c$ are the number of rows\\n    and columns in the grid representing the city and $p$ is the number of people who need\\n    to hear the watchman. They are identified by the first\\n    $p$ uppercase letters of\\n    the English alphabet (the first person is A, the second is B,\\n    and so on).\\nThe next $p$ lines\\n    describe the hearing ranges of those people, in that same\\n    order. Each line has an integer $1 \\\\leq h_ i \\\\leq 15$ indicating the\\n    range that person $i$ can\\n    hear (in kilometers).\\nThe next $r$ lines\\n    describe the map. Each line has $c$ space-separated tokens. Each token\\n    is either an integer $0 \\\\leq w\\n    \\\\leq 1\\\\, 000$ or a uppercase English letter. If the\\n    value is an integer, it is the amount of time (in minutes) it\\n    takes to enter that cell of the grid.

CC0 by Martijn Boer on Flickr\\n\\nIn recent years, CPU manufacturers have found it\\n    increasingly difficult to keep up with Moore’s law of doubling\\n    the number of transistors on integrated circuit chips every two\\n    years. To address this, manufacturers have instead started\\n    creating CPUs with an increasingly higher number of cores. In\\n    fact, you just purchased a CPU with a staggering $n$ number of cores, no less!\\n    Incidentally, you also have an array of $n+1$ integers, $a_0, a_1, \\\\ldots , a_ n$, that you\\n    need to sort. To make good use of the large number of cores on\\n    your CPU, you have devised a parallel sorting algorithm in\\n    which there is a dedicated core for comparing each adjacent\\n    pair of integers. As long as the array is not sorted in\\n    non-decreasing order, the algorithm proceeds in rounds that\\n    alternate between:\\n\\n\\nOdd rounds (starting with the first): The first core\\n        compares $a_0$ and\\n        $a_1$, the third core\\n        compares $a_2$ and\\n        $a_3$, the fifth core\\n        compares $a_4$ and\\n        $a_5$, and so on. If a\\n        pair of compared elements are out of order, the\\n        corresponding core will swap their positions. If\\n        $n$ is even,\\n        $a_ n$ will be left\\n        untouched.\\n\\n\\nEven rounds: The second core compares $a_1$ and $a_2$, the fourth core compares\\n        $a_3$ and $a_4$, the sixth core compares\\n        $a_5$ and $a_6$, and so on. If a pair of\\n        compared elements are out of order, the corresponding core\\n        will swap their positions. If $n$ is odd, $a_ n$ will be left untouched, and\\n        $a_0$ will be left\\n        untouched no matter what the parity of $n$ is.\\n\\n\\nNote that in both types of rounds some cores may be\\n    idle.\\nBefore implementing this algorithm, you have decided to do\\n    some analysis. In particular, you noticed that the time\\n    complexity of the algorithm does not depend on the value of\\n    $n$, but rather it depends\\n    on the number of rounds that the algorithm runs.

Transposing means that\\n    all tones are shifted either up or down by some fixed number of\\n    tones. For example, C#4 (C# in the fourth octave) transposed\\n    $5$ tones down would be\\n    G#3. Furthermore, Anton is not very good at reading sheet\\n    music.

What is the smallest number of digits that\\n    need to be changed in one such list of numbers, to ensure that\\n    it is sorted?\\nInput\\nThe input consists of:\\n\\n\\none line containing the integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\\\le n \\\\le 40$, $1 \\\\le m \\\\le 400$), the number of\\n        numbers and the number of digits in each number,\\n        respectively.\\n\\n\\n$n$ lines each\\n        containing an integer $v$ ($0 \\\\le v < 10^{m}$). The\\n        numbers are zero-padded to exactly $m$ digits.\\n\\n\\nOutput\\nWrite a sorted version of the array, after making a minimum\\n    number of digit changes to make the numbers sorted (the numbers\\n    must remain zero-padded to $m$ digits). If there are multiple\\n    optimal solutions, you may give any of them.\\n\\n\\nSample Input 1\\nSample Output 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5 3\\n111\\n001\\n000\\n111\\n000\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n001\\n001\\n001\\n111\\n200\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Input 2\\nSample Output 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15 3\\n999\\n888\\n777\\n666\\n555\\n444\\n333\\n222\\n111\\n222\\n333\\n444\\n555\\n666\\n999\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n199\\n288\\n377\\n466\\n555\\n644\\n733\\n822\\n911\\n922\\n933\\n944\\n955\\n966\\n999',\n",

The only drawback is that the beam is rather\\n    narrow and Arnar isn’t always sure where the enemies are\\n    located.

To improve the user experience,\\n    your team has decided to add an auto completion feature to the\\n    search box. However all other team members are busy. So you are\\n    asked to program the auto completion algorithm.\\n    The auto completion algorithm works based on a pre-defined\\n    dictionary of $n$ words.\\n    Suppose the search box contains the text $w$. When the user presses the tab key\\n    $i$ times in a row, the\\n    algorithm finds the $i$-th\\n    lexicographically smallest word from the dictionary that has\\n    $w$ as its non-trivial prefix. If there are fewer than\\n    $i$ words that have\\n    $w$ as prefix, the\\n    algorithm circulates through these words. That is, if there are\\n    $j < i$ words that have\\n    $w$ as prefix, the\\n    $(j+1)$-th tab press goes\\n    back to the lexicographically smallest word, and the\\n    $(j+2)$-th tab press gives\\n    the second lexicographically smallest word, and so on. The\\n    chosen word then replaces the text in the search box. If there\\n    are no words that have $w$\\n    as prefix, pressing the tab has no effect. When the user types\\n    a letter, the letter is directly appended to the text.\\nFor example, suppose the dictionary has four words:\\n    “albert”, “app”, “apple”, and “appletree”. If the user types\\n    “app” and then presses the tab key twice, she will get\\n    “appletree”, which is the second lexicographically smallest\\n    word that has “app” as non-trivial prefix. If she presses the\\n    tab key three times instead after typing “app”, she will get\\n    “apple” by the word circulation design. The user may also\\n    obtain “appletree” by first typing “a”, pressing the tab key\\n    three times (getting “apple”), typing two letters “tr”, and\\n    finally pressing the tab key once.\\nYou team has prepared some simulated user keystroke\\n    sequences for you to test the auto completion.\\nInput\\nThe first line has a single integer $n$ ($1\\n    \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$), the number of words in the\\n    dictionary.

The\\n    Babylonians used a base-$60$ system known as sexagesimal (not\\n    unlike our own base-$10$\\n    decimal system) where each ‘digit’ can take values between\\n    $1$ and $59$, inclusive. (The Babylonians\\n    didn’t have a digit to represent $0$; instead they would just leave the\\n    digit position empty.)

Recall that these are binary\\n    trees with two properties:\\n\\n\\nBalanced tree: For every node, the height of\\n        its left subtree and the height of its right subtree differ\\n        by at most $1$. For\\n        instance in Figure\\xa01, the left and right subtrees of\\n        node $7$ have heights\\n        $2$ and $1$, respectively. If a node does\\n        not have a left (or right) subtree then that subtree is\\n        considered to have height $0$.\\n\\n\\nSearch tree: Each node has a value. The value\\n        of a node is greater than all the values in the left\\n        subtree of the node, and smaller than all the values in the\\n        right subtree of the node. For instance in Figure\\xa01,\\n        the left subtree of node $7$ contains the values\\n        $4$, $5$ and $6$ which are all smaller than\\n        $7$.\\n\\n\\nAnna got a picture of such a tree from a colleague. This\\n    tree has $n$ nodes with\\n    the values $1$ to\\n    $n$. However, it turns out\\n    to be too big to fit on her slides so she would like to make it\\n    smaller. In particular, she would like to erase some nodes from\\n    the tree such that it has exactly $k$ remaining nodes. Whenever she\\n    erases a node, she also erases the subtrees of that node. Of\\n    course, the resulting tree must still be a balanced binary\\n    search tree.\\nFor pedagogical purposes, Anna would like the node values in\\n    her final tree to be small. Therefore, she wants the list of\\n    the $k$ remaining node\\n    values to be the lexicographically smallest possible.

The reason is that each of\\n    them has already mastered exactly one ball trick – either the\\n    Triple Spin, or the Power Charge. For convenience, we call the former\\n    trick 1 and the latter trick 2. These two tricks are extremely\\n    effective in attack.\\nBesides mastering such powerful trick, each of them also\\n    knows how to defend against exactly one ball trick. Therefore,\\n    one of their popular training routines is to let two players\\n    play against each other, one using a trick and the other trying\\n    to defend against it. We call this a move. The one who uses a\\n    trick is called an attacker, and the other is called a\\n    defender.\\nRB’s team can perform sequences of moves. To state it more\\n    concisely, we use the notation $(\\\\text {Attacker}, \\\\text {Defender})$\\n    to represent a move. Suppose the current move is $(\\\\texttt{A}, \\\\texttt{B})$. A performs the only trick he knows.\\n\\n\\nIf A attacks successfully\\n        (i.e., B fails to defend), the\\n        next move will normally be $(\\\\texttt{A}, \\\\texttt{C})$ for\\n        some other player C.\\n\\n\\nHowever, if it is the third consecutive time A attacks successfully, A will have to take a rest for the next two\\n        moves and the next move will be $(\\\\texttt{C}, \\\\texttt{D})$ for\\n        some other players C and\\n        D.\\n\\n\\nIf A fails (i.e., B defends successfully), the next move will\\n        be $(\\\\texttt{B},\\n        \\\\texttt{C})$ for some other player C.\\n\\n\\nNote that in all cases, A,\\n    B, C, and\\n    D must be pairwise distinct players.\\n    In addition, C and D must not be at rest for the next\\n    move.\\nToday, RB inspects the team training.

Each gang has one member for each piece of gold\\n    collectively owned by the gang. Every night one gang will raid\\n    the hideout of another gang to steal gold. However, in the\\n    spirit of inclusivity, one gang may only conduct a raid if\\n    every member of the gang can steal one piece of gold from the\\n    targeted gang. Thus, a gang with $n$ members can raid a gang with\\n    $m$ pieces of gold if and\\n    only if $n\\\\leq m$. After a\\n    raid, the raiding gang will gain one piece of gold for every\\n    member of the gang, and the raided gang will lose one piece of\\n    gold for every member of the raiding gang. Bandits are not\\n    content to be part of a gang if they do not have their very own\\n    piece of gold. So, after a raid, some members of the targeted\\n    gang will leave to join the raiding gang such that every bandit\\n    has their own piece of gold again. That is, after gang\\n    $A$ with $n$ members and $n$ pieces of gold raids gang\\n    $B$ with $m$ pieces of gold and $m$ members, gang $A$ will have $2n$ pieces of gold and $2n$ gang members and gang\\n    $B$ will have $m-n$ pieces of gold and $m-n$ gang members.\\nBehind the planning of all raids is one mastermind, Steve.\\n    Steve has convinced each of the gangs to trust him, unbeknownst\\n    to the others, such that on each night a raid will be conducted\\n    at Steve’s direction. Steve has grown tired of the constant\\n    fighting and wants to see it end as soon as possible, before\\n    the gangs realize that Steve is manipulating them. The fighting\\n    will end as soon as one gang has no gold remaining. Help Steve\\n    stop the fighting by finding a short sequence of raids that\\n    will entirely deplete one gang of its gold.\\nInput\\nThe input consists of $3$ space-separated positive integers,\\n    $a, b, c$, the number of\\n    gang members and pieces of gold that the Marauders, the\\n    Attackers, and the Plunderers initially have, respectively.

We need to figure out what\\n    that critical level is. We now know from, umm, “field testing”,\\n    that the laptop can explode when delivering $n$ milliAmperes (mA), but it is\\n    possible that explosion could occur below that level.

The testing device\\n    is constructed in such a way that the battery will always\\n    explode if there’s any risk of explosion at that current.\\nYou don’t want to spend too much time testing (time is\\n    money), so you want to run as few tests as possible while still\\n    figuring out the maximum current which is safe.

       " 'batterup': 'While the Chicago Cubs were ecstatic with their 2016 World\\n    Series championship, they were eliminated from the playoffs in\\n    2017. Looking ahead to 2018 they are beginning to embrace the\\n    more data-driven analysis of player’s values known as\\n    Sabermetrics.\\nFor example, a player’s batting average is calculated by\\n    dividing the total number of base hits by the total number of\\n    official at-bats. One limitation of using the batting average\\n    to evaluate players is that it treats all hits equally, rather\\n    than taking into account doubles, triples or home runs. For\\n    this reason, analysts often prefer to consider what is known as\\n    the slugging percentage, which distinguishes between\\n    different hit outcomes. To calculate the slugging percentage,\\n    the total number of bases of all hits is divided by\\n    the total numbers of time at bat, that did not result in walks,\\n    or at-bats.\\nMore specifically, an at-bat can earn $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$ or $4$ bases (these are referred to as\\n    official at-bats). Furthermore, some at-bats, such as\\n    those that result in a base-on-balls (i.e., a “walk”) are not\\n    considered in either the player’s batting average or slugging\\n    percentage.\\nFor example, if a player hits a triple ($3$\\xa0bases), strikes out\\n    ($0$\\xa0bases), and hits\\n    a double ($2$\\xa0bases),\\n    their slugging percentage would be $\\\\frac{3+0+2}{3} \\\\approx 1.6667$. If a\\n    player hits a single ($1$\\xa0base), walks, and hits a home\\n    run ($4$\\xa0bases), the\\n    slugging level would be $\\\\frac{1\\n    + 4}{2}=2.5$. Notice that in this case, the denominator\\n    is two, not three, because the walk does not count towards the\\n    slugging percentage.\\nInput\\nThe input is composed of two lines. The first line contains\\n    a single positive integer $n$ ($1\\n    \\\\le n \\\\le 100$) that specifies the number of at-bats.\\n    The second line contains $n$ integers, separated by spaces,\\n    each describing one of those at-bats.

For simplicity, let’s\\n    assume trainer $A$ chooses\\n    Pokenom $a$ and trainer\\n    $B$ chooses Pokenom\\n    $b$. The battle consists\\n    of exactly $K$ rounds. In\\n    each round, there are exactly two steps:\\n\\n\\nStep $1$: Pokenom\\n        $a$ attacks Pokenom\\n        $b$. The attack can be\\n        effective or not effective.\\n\\n\\nStep $2$: Pokenom\\n        $b$ attacks Pokenom\\n        $a$. The attack can be\\n        effective or not effective.\\n\\n\\nIf an attack is effective, the corresponding trainer will\\n    receive exactly $1$ point.\\n    Otherwise, the trainer does not receive any points. After all\\n    $K$ rounds, the trainer\\n    with more points wins. If the trainers have the same number of\\n    points, the battle is a draw.\\nBash watched several Pokenom battles between trainers\\n    $A$ and $B$. Bash wrote down the result of all\\n    steps (there are exactly $2 \\\\cdot\\n    K$ steps in total).\\nAfter carefully reviewing the result, Bash noticed something\\n    extraordinary: It is possible to know the outcome of the battle\\n    before the last step! More formally, for each battle, there\\n    exist a smallest step $S \\\\le 2\\n    \\\\cdot K$, such that no matter what happens from step\\n    $S + 1$ to step\\n    $2 \\\\cdot K$, we know for\\n    sure which trainer wins the battle, or if the battle is a\\n    draw.\\nFor example, consider the following battle with $K = 5$: (E for ‘effective’ and N for\\n    ‘not effective’):\\n\\n\\nRound $1$: ‘E\\n        E’\\n\\n\\nRound $2$: ‘E\\n        N’\\n\\n\\nRound $3$: ‘E\\n        E’\\n\\n\\nRound $4$: ‘E\\n        E’\\n\\n\\nRound $5$: ‘E\\n        N’\\n\\n\\nAfter $S = 9$ steps\\n    (i.e. after the first step of the $5$-th round), $A$ has $P_ A = 5$ points and $B$ has $P_ B = 3$ points. No matter what\\n    happens in the $10$-th\\n    step, we know for sure that $A$ wins.\\nExcited, Bash immediately tells his friend Cee $3$ numbers: $S$ - the earliest step after which Bash know for sure\\n    which Pokenom trainer wins the battle, $P_ A$ - how many points Pokenom\\n    trainer $A$ has after\\n    $S$ steps, and\\n    $P_ B$ - how many points\\n    Pokenom trainer $B$ has\\n    after $S$ steps.\\nAfter that, Bash tells Cee the result of each step from\\n    $1$ to $S$. However, after only $C$ steps, Cee stops Bash and tell\\n    him: ‘now I know the result of all steps from $C + 1$ to $S$’.\\nFor example, in the above battle, Bash tells Cee\\n    $S = 9$, $P_ A = 5$ and $P_ B = 3$. Bash then tells Cee the\\n    result of each step. After $C =\\n    4$ steps, here are the result given to Cee (‘?’\\n    indicates that the result is not given):\\n\\n\\nRound 1: ‘E E’\\n\\n\\nRound 2: ‘E N’\\n\\n\\nRound 3: ‘? ?’\\n\\n\\nRound 4: ‘? ?’\\n\\n\\nRound 5: ‘? ?’\\n\\n\\nBecause Cee also knows that after $S = 9$ steps, $A$ has $P_ A = 5$ points and $P_ B = 3$ points, he can deduce that\\n    $A$ gains $3$ more points in step $5$, $7$ and $9$, and $B$ gains $2$ more points in step $6$, $8$.\\nAs Cee is very smart, he always tells Bash as soon as he can\\n    infer the result of all step from $1$ to $S$. In other words, $C$ should be as small as possible.\\n    Also, remember that Cee knows the meaning of the number\\n    $S$: the winner (if any)\\n    is surely determined after $S$ steps, but not after $S - 1$ steps.\\nGiven the result of all $2\\n    \\\\cdot K$ steps, find the numbers $S$ and $C$.\\nInput\\nThe first line of input contains exactly one positive\\n    integer $T$ - the number\\n    of test cases $(1 \\\\le T \\\\le\\n    65)$.\\n$T$ test cases follow,\\n    each test case consists of:\\n\\n\\nThe first line contains exactly one positive integer\\n        $K$ $(1 \\\\le K \\\\le 6)$.\\n\\n\\nIn the next $K$\\n        lines, the $i$-th line\\n        contains $2$\\n        space-separated characters, representing the result of the\\n        $2$ steps in the\\n        $i$-th round.\\n\\n\\nOutput\\nFor each test case, print exactly one line containing\\n    $2$ integers $S$ and $C$.\\n\\n\\nSample Input 1\\nSample Output 1\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n5\\nE E\\nE N\\nE E\\nE E\\nE N\\n3\\nN E\\nN E\\nE N\\n\\n\\n\\n9 4 \\n4 0',\n",

This\\n    classical style of bridge is supported by pillars that extend\\n    from the ground below the bridge. Arches between pillars\\n    distribute the bridge’s weight onto the adjacent pillars.\\nThe bridges built by ABC often have pillars spaced at\\n    irregular intervals. For aesthetic reasons, ABC’s bridges\\n    always have semicircular arches, as illustrated in Figure 1.\\n    However, while a bridge arch can touch the ground, it cannot\\n    extend below the ground.

The\\n    first and last pillars must be built at the first and last key\\n    points, and any intermediate pillars can be built only at these\\n    key points. The cost of a bridge is the cost of its pillars\\n    (which is proportional to their heights) plus the cost of its\\n    arches (which is proportional to the amount of material used).\\n    So a bridge with $k$\\n    pillars of heights $h_1, \\\\dots ,\\n    h_ k$ that are separated by horizontal distances\\n    $d_1, \\\\dots , d_{k-1}$ has\\n    a total cost of\\\\[ \\\\alpha\\n    \\\\cdot \\\\sum _{i=1}^ k h_ i + \\\\beta \\\\cdot \\\\sum _{i=1}^{k-1} d_\\n    i^2 \\\\]\\nfor some given constants $\\\\alpha $ and $\\\\beta $.

Among all such moves, he will pick one uniformly at\\n    random.\\nYou are given the string $s$, and your task is to write a\\n    program that decides what moves Erik should make in order to\\n    pick at least as many berries as grandpa.\\nInteraction\\nThe first line of input contains the number $N$, the length of the string\\n    $s$.

       " 'bikegears': 'Image by Keithonearth (Wikimedia\\n        Commons), CC BY-SA\\n        3.0\\n\\n\\nMany multi-gear (multi-speed) bicycles have a drivetrain\\n    mechanism that is structured as follows: the pedals are\\n    attached to a front set of sprockets (toothed wheels), which is\\n    connected by a chain to a back set of sprockets, which in turn\\n    is attached to the rear wheel. The chain can shift, under the\\n    cyclist’s control, to any one of the front sprockets and to any\\n    one of the back sprockets (sometimes there are mechanical\\n    limitations that preclude certain front-back combinations, but\\n    we don’t have to worry about that here). As the cyclist moves\\n    the pedals forward, the force is transferred from the pedals to\\n    the selected front sprocket, to the chain, to the selected back\\n    sprocket, and finally to the rear wheel; it is the motion of\\n    the rear wheel that drives the bike forward.\\nThe gear the bike is in at any point in time is\\n    given by the ordered pair $(f,b)$, where $f$ is the number of teeth on the\\n    currently selected front sprocket, and $b$ is the number of teeth on the\\n    currently selected back sprocket. The ratio $f/b$ is used to compare gears. A\\n    higher (respectively, lower) ratio corresponds to a higher\\n    (respectively, lower) gear. Therefore, for example, to change\\n    into a lower gear, the cyclist can shift the chain either onto\\n    a smaller front sprocket or onto a larger back sprocket (or\\n    both). Most cyclists change gears easily and intuitively in\\n    response to variations in terrain. However, for bicycles with a\\n    relatively large number of gears, figuring out how to progress\\n    through the gears in order from lowest to highest can\\n    be surprisingly non-obvious, and in fact most cyclists likely\\n    do not know how to do this.\\nGiven information about the front and back sprockets on a\\n    bicycle with the drivetrain structure described above, your\\n    task is to determine the exact sequence of $(f,b)$ sprocket pairs that a cyclist\\n    would need to select to progress, in order, through all the\\n    gears from lowest to highest. If two different gears,\\n    $(f_1, b_1)$ and\\n    $(f_2, b_2)$, yield the\\n    same ratio, then the gear with the lower $f$ value is considered to be the\\n    lower of the two gears.\\nInput\\nThe input contains a single test case given on three lines.\\n    The first line contains two space-separated integers,\\n    $F$ and $B$ ($1 \\\\leq F,B \\\\leq\\n    50$), the number of front sprockets and the\\n    number of back sprockets, respectively. The second line\\n    contains $F$ distinct\\n    space-separated integers in decreasing order, the number of\\n    teeth on each of the front sprockets. The third line contains\\n    $B$ distinct\\n    space-separated integers in decreasing order, the number of\\n    teeth on each of the back sprockets. Every sprocket has between\\n    $4$ and $10^9$ teeth, inclusive.\\nOutput\\nOutput one line for each of the $F \\\\cdot B$ gears. Give these in order\\n    from the lowest gear to the highest gear.

Each number\\n    appears at most once per card. The bingo caller calls out a\\n    sequence of randomly drawn numbers, and the players mark the\\n    numbers that appear on their card as they are called out. The\\n    winner is the player that completes a line of five marked\\n    numbers (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) on his or her\\n    card. The winning player then yells “bingo” and the game\\n    ends.\\nYou have been volunteering with a local youth group and have\\n    been running bingo games for the children. They love bingo, but\\n    every time two or more kids yell “bingo” at the same time, a\\n    spirited “disagreement” breaks out. You’ve created a slightly\\n    modified version of bingo (in the hopes of introducing fewer\\n    ties): the cards are $5$-by-$5$ grids with a number from\\n    $1$ to $3\\\\, 000$ in each of the $25$ cells, and a winner is only\\n    declared when a player has $5$ numbers in a row. Note that in\\n    this new game, players cannot win via\\n    columns or diagonals.\\nAlas, these changes did not eliminate ties or the subsequent\\n    disagreements. To prevent further disagreements, you’ve decided\\n    to analyze the sets of cards to determine if there is any\\n    possibility that a tie (where two kids can yell bingo at the\\n    same time) can occur. Write a program that takes a collection\\n    of bingo cards and determines if there is any possible sequence\\n    of numbers that could be called so that the game ends, and a\\n    tie between two or more players occurs, when the last number in\\n    the sequence is called.\\nFor example, consider the following two bingo cards:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$ \\\\begin{array}{ccccc}\\n            3 & 29 & 45 & 56 & 68 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 19\\n            & 43 & 50 & 72 \\\\\\\\ 11 & 25 & 40\\n            & 49 & 61 \\\\\\\\ 9 & 23 & 31 & 58 &\\n            63 \\\\\\\\ 4 & 27 & 42 & 54 & 71 \\\\end{array}\\n            $\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n$ \\\\begin{array}{ccccc}\\n            14 & 23 & 39 & 59 & 63 \\\\\\\\ 8 & 17\\n            & 35 & 55 & 61 \\\\\\\\ 15 & 26 & 42\\n            & 53 & 71 \\\\\\\\ 10 & 25 & 31 & 57\\n            & 64 \\\\\\\\ 6 & 20 & 44 & 52 & 68 \\\\\\\\\\n            \\\\end{array} $\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen this set of two cards could result in a tie if the\\n    sequence of numbers called was\\\\[ 40~ 61~ 64~ 10~ 57~ 49~ 11~ 31~ 25\\n    \\\\]\\nThis sequence would result in the card on the left\\n    completing the third row and the card on the right completing\\n    the fourth row when the number $25$ is called.\\nInput\\nThe first line of the input is an integer $n$ ($2\\n    \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$), the number of bingo cards.

Scattered throughout the\\n    reserve are various types of nesting boxes, and one of Ollie’s\\n    tasks is to regularly check on the boxes. The only way to\\n    travel between the boxes is via a set of dirt roads which meet\\n    at various junctions in the reserve, and the only way for Ollie\\n    to travel on these roads is with an old, beat up tractor\\n    (funding hasn’t been the greatest for the past few years).\\n    Recently, a problem has developed with the steering mechanism\\n    of the tractor which limits the turning angles available. Since\\n    the junctions are relatively small, the roads that Ollie can\\n    take when entering a junction can be restricted. For example,\\n    in Figure 1, if Ollie enters the junction from road A he may be\\n    able to leave on either roads B or C, but if he enters via road\\n    B, the constrained turning angle may only allow him to leave on\\n    road A (the same could happen if he entered on road C).\\nIn addition, due to uneven terrain, it is possible that\\n    traveling a road in one direction may take longer than\\n    traveling the road in the opposite direction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Sample junction.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Map of Sample Input $1$.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs an example, Figure\\xa02 illustrates the map of the\\n    reserve described in the first sample input.

The\\n    underlying assumptions for this are that all birthdays are\\n    equally likely (which isn’t quite true), the year has exactly\\n    $365$ days (which also\\n    isn’t true), and the people in the group are uniformly randomly\\n    selected (which is a somewhat strange premise). For this\\n    problem, we’ll accept these assumptions.\\nConsider what we might observe if we randomly select groups\\n    of $P=10$ people. Once we\\n    have chosen a group, we break them up into subgroups based on\\n    shared birthdays. Among many other\\n    possibilities, we might observe the following distributions of\\n    shared birthdays:\\n\\n\\nall $10$ have\\n        different birthdays, or\\n\\n\\nall $10$ have the\\n        same birthday, or\\n\\n\\n$3$ people have the\\n        same birthday, $2$\\n        other people have the same birthday (on a different day),\\n        and the remaining $5$\\n        all have different birthdays.\\n\\n\\nOf course, these distributions have different probabilities\\n    of occurring.\\nYour job is to calculate this probability for a given\\n    distribution of people sharing birthdays.

All through the night,\\n    the Troublemakers work tirelessly, arranging rocks in the shape\\n    of hideous, misshapen blobs on the lawns of the unsuspecting\\n    residents of Quackville. For the sake of efficiency, the MTA\\n    splits up into several factions, each of which covers a\\n    particular neighbourhood. The faction in charge of spreading\\n    doom to a given neighbourhood never visits the same lawn twice.\\n    While there is no consistency whatsoever as to the shapes of\\n    the evil rock blobs, the MTA is very specific about the number\\n    of rocks each blob should contain. In order to generate this\\n    number easily, the $k^{\\\\mathrm{th}}$ faction\\n    ($k \\\\geq 1$) has devised a\\n    sequence, $F_ k(n)$, whose\\n    $n^{\\\\mathrm{th}}$ term\\n    ($n \\\\geq 1$) is the number\\n    of rocks its members will use to make their blob on the\\n    $n^{\\\\mathrm{th}}$ lawn\\n    they visit. This sequence can be defined recursively\\n    by\\\\begin{align*} F_ k(1)\\n    & = 42\\\\\\\\ F_ k(2) & = 11k + 77\\\\\\\\ F_ k(n) & = 2F_ k(n\\n    - 1) - F_ k(n - 2) + 10k \\\\, , \\\\ \\\\textrm{ for } n > 2\\n    \\\\end{align*}\\nSo, for example, the members of the first faction\\n    ($k = 1$) place\\n    $42$ rocks on the first\\n    lawn they visit, $88$\\n    rocks on the second lawn they visit, then $144$, $210$, $286$, and so on, on subsequent\\n    lawns.\\nWhile others stare confusedly at the amorphous piles of\\n    rocks, wondering what any of this has to do with world\\n    domination, Rex Tangleton leaps into action! Despite a complete\\n    lack of evidence, he is convinced that Quackvillians can only\\n    be saved if someone turns these ghastly blobs of doom into\\n    wonderful rectangles. According to Rex, a $p$ by $q$ rectangle of rocks is wonderful if\\n    $p$ and $q$ are prime. Note that he does not\\n    care whether or not $p$\\n    and $q$ are equal. For\\n    each lawn that he visits, he will rearrange all of the rocks in\\n    the blob into a wonderful rectangle if this is possible.\\n    Otherwise, he will simply stare at the rocks and grunt, but not\\n    move any of them.\\nOriginally, Rex had been planning to check as many lawns as\\n    possible. However, he has been informed that his grunting\\n    frightens people, and he will therefore not be paid for his\\n    work. Saving your community is no fun if you do not get\\n    remunerated, so Rex decides to pick random positive integers\\n    $k$ and $n$, and then check only the first\\n    $n$ lawns that the\\n    $k^{\\\\mathrm{th}}$ faction\\n    has visited.

When a loaf falls through a gate\\n    into a downward tunnel, the gate closes the tunnel and opens\\n    another one, to which it is connected, for the next arriving\\n    loaf.

       " 'buffet': 'You are buying lunch at a buffet. A number of different\\n    dishes are available, and you can mix and match them to your\\n    heart’s desire. Some of the dishes, such as dumplings and\\n    roasted potatoes, consist of pieces of roughly equal size, and\\n    you can pick an integral number of such pieces (no splitting is\\n    allowed). Refer to these as “discrete dishes.” Other dishes,\\n    such as tzatziki or mashed potatoes, are fluid and you can pick\\n    an arbitrary real-valued amount of them. Refer to this second\\n    type as “continuous dishes.”\\nOf course, you like some of the dishes more than others, but\\n    how much you like a dish also depends on how much of it you\\n    have already eaten. For instance, even if you generally prefer\\n    dumplings to potatoes, you might prefer a potato over a\\n    dumpling if you have already eaten ten dumplings. To model\\n    this, each dish $i$ has an\\n    initial tastiness $t_ i$,\\n    and a rate of decay of the tastiness $\\\\Delta t_ i$. For discrete dishes,\\n    the tastiness you experience when eating the $n^{th}$ item of the dish is\\n    $t_ i - (n-1)\\\\Delta t_ i$.\\n    For continuous dishes, the tastiness you experience when eating\\n    an infinitesimal amount $d\\n    x$ grams of the dish after already having eaten\\n    $x$ grams is $(t_ i - x \\\\Delta t_ i) d x$. In other\\n    words, the respective total amounts of tastiness you experience\\n    when eating $N$ items of a\\n    discrete dish or $X$ grams\\n    of a continuous dish are as follows:\\\\begin{align*} \\\\sum _{n=1}^{N} (t_ i -\\n    (n-1)\\\\Delta t_ i) & & \\\\text {and} & & \\\\int\\n    _{0}^ X (t_ i - x\\\\Delta t_ i) dx \\\\end{align*}\\nFor simplicity, do not take into account that different\\n    dishes may or may not go well together, so define the total\\n    tastiness that you experience from a meal as the sum of the\\n    total tastinesses of the individual dishes in the meal (and the\\n    same goes for the weight of a meal – there are no food\\n    antiparticles in the buffet!).\\nYou have spent days of painstaking research determining the\\n    numbers $t_ i$ and\\n    $\\\\Delta t_ i$ for each of\\n    the dishes in the buffet.

The environment has a known start location\\n    and a known goal location. The robot is controlled with a\\n    string consisting of commands L,\\n    R, U, and\\n    D, which respectively instruct the\\n    robot to move one square to the left, right, up or down in the\\n    grid. The robot will ignore a command (but continue with future\\n    commands) if the command would cause it to leave the grid or to\\n    run into an obstacle. If the robot were to reach the goal\\n    position, it immediately stops its program with success (even\\n    if further commands exist).\\nYour friend has already programmed the robot with a command\\n    string, but the problem is that your friend is not a very good\\n    programmer, and so it may be that the commands do not lead the\\n    robot successfully to the goal. You would like to fix the\\n    string so that the robot will reach the goal, but you do not\\n    want your friend to feel bad, so you are hoping to make as few\\n    changes to the program as are needed. A single change consists\\n    either of deleting an arbitrary character of the command\\n    string, or inserting an arbitrary command anywhere within the\\n    string.\\nAs an example, if we consider Sample Input\\xa01, we see\\n    that your friend’s command string of DRRDD\\n    does not succeed. The initial D moves the\\n    robot one spot down. From there, the R (and\\n    the subsequent R) are ignored because of\\n    the obstacle to the robot’s right. The subsequent D moves the robot down once again and the final\\n    D is ignored. However, by deleting the\\n    initial D, we can rely on the command\\n    string RRDD which does successfully lead\\n    the robot to the goal.\\nIf we consider Sample Input\\xa02, we find that your\\n    friend’s original command string LDLDLLDR\\n    is flawed. However, if we insert the single command U after the fifth command, the resulting string\\n    LDLDLULDR successfully guides the robot to\\n    the goal. It starts by moving left-down-left; the next down\\n    command is ignored because the robot is not allowed to leave\\n    the grid. The subsequent left-up-left completes the path to the\\n    goal (and the final DR commands are ignored\\n    as the robot stops immediately upon reaching the goal).\\nWith Sample Input\\xa03, your friend’s command string can\\n    be corrected with two changes, for example with the new command\\n    ULDLDLLDLR (although this is not the only\\n    way to use two changes to produce a valid sequence).\\nInput\\nThe first line of the input contains the two integers\\n    $H$ and $W$ that respectively define the\\n    height and width of the grid such that $1 \\\\le H, W \\\\le 50$.

       " 'buriedtreasure': 'Image by \\n        Csaba Jakab (Shutterstock), Used under license\\n      \\n\\nYou may be under the impression that treasure maps originate\\n    from pirates, who create maps after burying their treasure so\\n    that they will later have a way to retrieve their stolen\\n    fortunes. In reality, it is extremely rare for pirates to bury\\n    treasure; there are only a few such documented cases.\\nAs it turns out, the vast majority of treasure maps are\\n    published by the Mapping Association of Plunder and Spoils\\n    (MAPS), a secretive group of people responsible for curating\\n    reports of lost or stolen treasure and then making and selling\\n    corresponding treasure maps.\\nOver the years, MAPS has become increasingly creative with\\n    the structure of its treasure maps, so these maps no longer\\n    resemble a stereotypical treasure map. In fact, they no longer\\n    come in one piece; treasure hunters must assemble a map from\\n    multiple pieces before being able to use it to locate buried\\n    treasure.\\nFormally, an assembled treasure map is a rectangular grid of\\n    squares, where each square indicates the rectilinear distance\\n    (sum of horizontal distance and vertical distance) to the\\n    square containing the treasure, modulo $10$.\\nGiven a list of smaller rectangular map pieces, you must\\n    rearrange the pieces to reconstruct a valid rectangular map,\\n    rotating (but not flipping) the pieces as needed. Every map\\n    piece must be used exactly once in the reconstructed map, no\\n    two map pieces may overlap, and the reconstructed map must not\\n    contain any gaps.\\nInput\\nThe first line contains an integer, $N$ ($2\\\\leq N\\\\leq 8$), indicating the\\n    number of rectangular map pieces. This is followed by a series\\n    of lines describing each map piece. The description of the\\n    $i$-th piece ($1\\\\leq i\\\\leq N$) begins with a line\\n    containing two space-separated integers, $W_ i$ and $H_ i$, giving the $i$-th piece’s width and height,\\n    respectively, where $1\\\\leq W_ i,\\n    H_ i\\\\leq 10$. This is followed by $H_ i$ lines of $W_ i$ characters each, where each\\n    character represents one square of the map piece (using a digit\\n    from $0$ to $9$, inclusive). It is guaranteed that\\n    one of the map pieces contains a square corresponding to the\\n    location of the treasure.\\nOutput\\nOutput a line containing $W$ and $H$, separated by a single space,\\n    where $W$ is the width and\\n    $H$ is the height of a\\n    valid reconstructed map (such a reconstruction will always be\\n    possible). Then output the reconstructed map as $H$ lines of $W$ characters each. (In the event\\n    that there are multiple possible maps that can be produced, it\\n    suffices to output any one of them, in any of the $4$ possible rotations.) On the\\n    following line, output $W$\\n    hyphen (‘-’) characters. Then output\\n    $H$ lines of $W$ characters each, where each\\n    character is a digit between $1$ and $N$, inclusive, that is the\\n    ($1$-based) index of the map\\n    piece to which the corresponding square in the reconstructed\\n    map belongs. (For example, the digit in the bottom-left corner\\n    of the first sample output is\\xa0$1$ because the corresponding digit in\\n    the reconstructed map (which happens to be\\xa0$2$) belongs to the $1$st map piece.)\\n\\n\\nSample Input 1\\nSample Output 1\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n4 1\\n2123\\n2 2\\n21\\n10\\n2 2\\n23\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\n4 3\\n2123\\n1012\\n2123\\n----\\n2233\\n2233\\n1111\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Input 2\\nSample Output 2\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n4 3\\n2101\\n3212\\n4323\\n4 2\\n3456\\n2345\\n1 1\\n5\\n3 1\\n434\\n\\n\\n\\n4 6\\n3456\\n2345\\n1234\\n0123\\n1234\\n2345\\n----\\n2222\\n2222\\n1114\\n1114\\n1114\\n1113',\n",

For example, the coin system in common use in Canada is\\n    $\\\\{ 1,5,10,25,100,200\\\\} $,\\n    where $1$ corresponds to a\\n    $1$-cent coin and $200$ corresponds to a $200$-cent ($2$-dollar) coin. For any coin\\n    system $S$, we assume that\\n    there is an unlimited supply of coins of each denomination, and\\n    we also assume that $S$\\n    contains $1$, since this\\n    guarantees that any positive integer can be written as a sum of\\n    (possibly repeated) values in $S$.\\nCashiers all over the world face (and solve) the following\\n    problem: For a given coin system and a positive integer amount\\n    owed to a customer, what is the smallest number of coins\\n    required to dispense exactly that amount? For example, suppose\\n    a cashier in Canada owes a customer $83$ cents. One possible solution is\\n    $25+25+10+10+10+1+1+1$,\\n    i.e., $8$ coins, but this\\n    is not optimal, since the cashier could instead dispense\\n    $25+25+25+5+1+1+1$, i.e.,\\n    $7$ coins (which\\n    is optimal in this case). Fortunately, the Canadian\\n    coin system has the nice property that the greedy\\n    algorithm always yields an optimal solution, as do the\\n    coin systems used in most countries. The greedy algorithm\\n    involves repeatedly choosing a coin of the largest denomination\\n    that is less than or equal to the amount still owed, until the\\n    amount owed reaches zero. A coin system for which the greedy\\n    algorithm is always optimal is called canonical.\\nYour challenge is this: Given a coin system $S = \\\\{ c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots , c_ n\\\\} $,\\n    determine whether $S$ is\\n    canonical or non-canonical. Note that if $S$ is non-canonical then there exists\\n    at least one counterexample, i.e., a positive integer\\n    $x$ such that the minimum\\n    number of coins required to dispense exactly $x$ is less than the number of coins\\n    used by the greedy algorithm. An example of a non-canonical\\n    coin system is $\\\\{ 1,3,4\\\\}\\n    $, for which $6$ is\\n    a counterexample, since the greedy algorithm yields\\n    $4+1+1$ ($3$ coins), but an optimal solution is\\n    $3+3$ ($2$ coins).

For example, Valles Marineris on\\n    Mars is a vast canyon system running along the Martian equator\\n    and is roughly the size of the United States.\\nWorking for a prestigious mapping company, you’ve been\\n    tasked with making maps for such canyons. A canyon can be\\n    represented in 2D by a simple polygon outline. The maps you\\n    will be constructing will be perfectly square and axis aligned.\\n    This is due to the mapping company’s desire that tops of their\\n    maps are always North. In order to increase the detail,\\n    sometimes multiple maps are used to cover just one canyon. Such\\n    a collection is called a mapping system. The mapping system of\\n    the canyon must cover the entire area of the canyon. The maps\\n    in the mapping system must also be the same scale with respect\\n    to the canyon and the same size with respect to their printing.\\n    This allows the maps to be easily compared when viewed\\n    together.\\nYour mapping system will have exactly $k$ maps. You need to find a mapping\\n    system that completely covers the canyon, but each map covers\\n    as little area as possible, since a map with less area can be\\n    shown at a higher detail. All of the maps must be perfectly\\n    square, and must cover the same amount of area on the canyon.\\n    The maps can overlap. Since area is the square of side length,\\n    just output the side length for simplicity. If things go well\\n    enough, your mapping system may even be used to map Valles\\n    Marineris in the near future.\\nInput\\nEach input will consist of a single test case.

The next\\n    $n$ lines each contain two\\n    space-separated integers $x$ $y$ ($-20\\\\, 000 \\\\le x, y \\\\le 20\\\\, 000$).\\n    These are the coordinates of the polygon, in order. No two\\n    edges of the polygon will intersect. All points will be\\n    distinct. No three consecutive points will be collinear.

Two\\n    intersections are adjacent if they are connected by a\\n    horizontal or vertical line with no other intersections between\\n    them.

The spectator then\\n      indicates which of the three columns contains the selected\\n      card, at which point the magician picks up the cards by\\n      columns, picking up the specified column second (the order of\\n      collecting the other two columns is unimportant). Cards are\\n      collected face up, beginning with the top card in each column\\n      and placing each succeeding card immediately beneath the\\n      previously collected card. The cards are then redealt by rows\\n      into a $3$-column grid,\\n      starting from the top of the face-up deck. The process is\\n      repeated two more times; each time, the column indicated by\\n      the spectator is the second column picked up by the magician.\\n      After three such iterations, Cardoni announces, “I have\\n      penetrated to the heart of your mind; your card lies at the\\n      heart of this display.” And it’s true—the selected card is\\n      located at the “heart” of the array (row four, column two).\\n      Moreover, the selected card will always remain in this stable\\n      location for any further iterations of the column indication\\n      and card redealing process.\\n    \\nThe process always works, no matter the number selected,\\n    provided that the column containing the secret number is the\\n    second column to be picked up and redealt.\\nCardoni would like to expand his trick to use different\\n    numbers of cards, rows, and columns, and to experiment with\\n    different orderings of picking up the columns after the\\n    spectator indicates a column.

The\\n    wall has since been removed and replaced by a system of\\n    interconnecting roads completely circumscribing the old part of\\n    the town. The roads inside still remains more or less the same\\n    as it was in the middle ages, which of course comes in conflict\\n    with modern requirements for accessibility by car, resulting in\\n    a maze of twisty little one-way streets, all alike, mixed with\\n    slightly wider two-way streets.\\nMaking changes to the traffic routes in such a city can\\n    easily cause unexpected side-effects if you do not plan\\n    carefully ahead.

       " 'catandmice': 'Photo by katie_mccolgan/Flickr\\n\\n\\nEveryone knows that cats love to eat mice. Naturally, when\\n    given the opportunity, any cat wants to eat as many mice as\\n    possible.\\nIt just so happens that Cartesian Cat lives on the Cartesian\\n    Plane with her home located at $(0, 0)$. Obviously, none of the mice\\n    live at this location, they are smarter than that! However, the\\n    mice aren’t terribly smart. They live on the plane with\\n    Cartesian Cat and at time $t =\\n    0$, stick their heads above the ground, in sight of\\n    Cartesian Cat. Each of the mice stays in sight at its location\\n    for a specified amount of time before ducking back underground,\\n    where Cartesian Cat can’t get it.\\nCartesian Cat has a plan. At time $t = 0$, she’ll run straight towards a\\n    mouse, eat it instantaneously, and then head for another mouse,\\n    repeating the sequence until all the mice are eaten. She\\n    encounters two problems however: each time she eats a mouse her\\n    velocity reduces (due to her increased mass) by a constant\\n    multiplicative factor, $m$. That is, if her velocity is\\n    $v$ before eating a mouse,\\n    then after eating the mouse her velocity is $v\\\\cdot m$. Also, if she doesn’t reach\\n    a mouse before it ducks underground, she won’t be able to eat\\n    it. But she can eat a mouse if she reaches it precisely at the\\n    time it ducks underground.\\nSince all cats are efficient by nature, help Cartesian Cat\\n    determine what her minimum initial velocity must be if she\\n    hopes to eat all of the mice. Assume that she eats the mice in\\n    an optimal order.\\nInput\\nThe first line of input contains a single positive integer,\\n    $n$ (where $1 \\\\le n \\\\le 15$), representing the\\n    number of mice. Each of the following $n$ lines describes a mouse given as\\n    three space-separated integers $x$, $y$, and $s$. This indicates that a mouse is\\n    located at $(x, y)$ and\\n    will duck underground at $t =\\n    s$ seconds. The values of $x$ and $y$ are in the range $[-1\\\\, 000, 1\\\\, 000]$ and $s$ is in the range $[1,10\\\\, 000]$. No two mice are at the\\n    same location. The last line of input contains a single\\n    floating-point number, $m$, specified to two decimal places,\\n    in the range $[0.75,\\n    0.99]$, representing the multiplicative factor by which\\n    the cat slows down after eating a single mouse.\\nOutput\\nOutput the minimum initial velocity (in units per second)\\n    necessary for Cartesian Cat to allow her to eat all of the\\n    mice, given that she eats them in the optimal order.

Unfortunately,\\n    some of the bus drivers are considering going on strike, so you\\n    do not know whether you can get to the airport on time. Your\\n    goal is to plan your journey in such a way as to maximize the\\n    probability of catching your plane.\\nYou have a detailed map of the city, which includes all the\\n    bus stations. You are at station $0$ and the airport is at station\\n    $1$. You also have a\\n    complete schedule of when each bus leaves its start station and\\n    arrives at its destination station. Additionally, for each bus\\n    you know the probability that it is actually going to run as\\n    scheduled, as opposed to its driver going on strike and taking\\n    the bus out of service.

That is, the probability of a given bus running as\\n    planned does not change if you know whether any of the other\\n    buses run as planned.\\nIf you arrive before the departure time of a bus,\\n    you can transfer to that bus. But if you arrive exactly at the\\n    departure time, you will not have enough time to get on the\\n    bus. You cannot verify ahead of time whether a given bus will\\n    run as planned – you will find out only when you try to get on\\n    the bus.

       " 'catcoat': 'Photo by Pedro Ribeiro Simões (pedrosimoes7) on flickr\\n      \\nThe color of a cat is primarily decided by three genes,\\n    coding for Black (Eumelanin), Red (Phaeomelanin) and Dilution\\n    (Melanophilin). The cat genetics experts among the readers will\\n    note that we are ignoring a wide range of genes, e.g.,\\n    Tyrosinase and the white masking gene – we apologize in advance\\n    for the oversimplifications that are to ensue.\\n\\n    Black is usually written as B, Red\\n    as O, Dilution as D. In general, a cat has two copies of each\\n    gene, one from each parent (except for the red gene which is\\n    sex-bound, we’ll return to that later). Each copy can be either\\n    dominant, which we’ll denote using an upper case\\n    letter, or recessive, which we’ll denote using a lower\\n    case letter. Thus for each gene there are three possibilities:\\n    either both copies of the gene are dominant, both are\\n    recessive, or one is dominant and the other is recessive. When\\n    describing a cat we’ll write this as a pair of letters, with\\n    the second one possibly being a “-”\\n    to indicate a wildcard. For example, “bb” indicates that the cat has two recessive\\n    black genes, and “B-” indicates that\\n    the cat has a dominant black gene and that we don’t care about\\n    whether the other one is dominant or recessive.\\nWhen a cat has no dominant red (O)\\n    gene, its coat will be a variation of black, according to the\\n    following four combinations:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nB-D-: Black\\n\\n\\nB-dd: Blue\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbbD-: Chocolate\\n\\n\\nbbdd: Lilac\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, red (O or o) is sex bound on the X chromosone. This means\\n    a male cat, or tom, only has a single red gene, while a female\\n    has two. Red dominates black, meaning that a cat having an\\n    O gene will always have red coloring.\\n    Like black, red is also affected by the dilution gene. For male\\n    cats, we have the following two possible red colors (here, the\\n    black genes have no effect on the coat color):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nD-O: Red\\n\\n\\nddO: Cream\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor female cats the situation gets a bit more complicated.\\n    If the female has two O genes she\\n    will be be red, with variations depending on the dilution gene\\n    in exactly the same way as for male red cats:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nD-OO: Red\\n\\n\\nddOO: Cream\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, a female cat with the Oo\\n    combination will have a partially black, partially red, coat.\\n    These cats are known as Torties (Tortoiseshells), and named\\n    after both their coat colours, starting with the black. The\\n    four possible Tortie colorings are thus as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nB-D-Oo: Black-Red\\n            Tortie\\n\\n\\nB-ddOo: Blue-Cream\\n            Tortie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbbD-Oo: Chocolate-Red\\n            Tortie\\n\\n\\nbbddOo: Lilac-Cream\\n            Tortie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen a pair of cats have kittens, the offspring will get a\\n    random set of genes from their parents according to the\\n    following simple process: for each gene, independently, one of\\n    the copies is selected uniformly at random from the father’s\\n    two copies, and the other copy is selected uniformly at random\\n    from the mother’s two copies. For the red gene, there is a\\n    $50\\\\% $ chance that the\\n    offspring will be female in which case it will get the father’s\\n    red gene (and one of the mother’s red genes at random), and a\\n    $50\\\\% $ chance that the\\n    offspring will be male in which case it will only get one of\\n    the mother’s red genes (at random).\\nWrite a program which, given the colors of two cats,\\n    computes the most likely color for their offspring. For cats\\n    having a color where some genes do not affect the color, assume\\n    that the corresponding genes are uniformly random (over the two\\n    choices dominant/recessive). For example, if a cat is red, you\\n    should assume that the possibilities “DD” and “Dd” for the\\n    dilution gene are equally likely, and that the four\\n    possibilities “BB”, “Bb”, “bB” and\\n    “bb” are equally likely for the black\\n    gene (but note that “Bb” and\\n    “bB” are equivalent).\\nInput\\nThe input consists of two lines. The first line gives the\\n    color of the female cat, and the second line gives the color of\\n    the male cat. Each color is spelled and capitalized exactly as\\n    when it is listed above, and the color is valid (i.e., the male\\n    cat won’t be a Tortie).\\nOutput\\nOutput a list of the possible color outcomes for the\\n    offspring of the two cats. Each line should contain a color\\n    followed by a number $0 < p\\n    \\\\le 1$ indicating the probability of this particular\\n    outcome.\\nThe list should be sorted first in decreasing order by\\n    probability, then in alphabetic order by name (see sample input\\n    3 below).

These scores are then\\n    interpreted somehow and the top universities in a number of\\n    categories are named. There are many categories to compete in\\n    (research university, undergraduate university, small\\n    university, etc.). Sometimes these categories appear to be\\n    invented just to make a particular university a “top\\n    university” (e.g. top university in rural area with population\\n    $30\\\\, 000$ to $45\\\\, 000$).\\nThe Institute of Advanced Category Manipulation (ACM) is not\\n    pleased with its ranking, because it is not a top university in\\n    any category. The public relations department of ACM has\\n    decided that it can invent its own category of universities,\\n    and rank each university based on a linear combination of the\\n    three scores.

Each objective $i$, $i\\n    = 2 \\\\ldots n$, has a prerequisite, $P_ i$, which must be completed before\\n    $i$. Of course, the first\\n    objective (always number $1$) has no prerequisite. There are no\\n    cycles of dependencies which would cause an objective to\\n    indirectly depend on itself.\\nLike all games, however, this game has hidden cheats. There\\n    is one cheat for each objective $i = 2 \\\\ldots n$ which allows it to be\\n    completed before its prerequisite! However, things still can’t\\n    be done too much out of order. If objective $i$’s cheat is used, then instead of\\n    objective $i$ being\\n    completed after its prerequisite $P_ i$, it just has to be completed\\n    after its prerequisite’s prerequisite, $P_{P_ i}$ (unless $P_ i = 1$, in which case it can be\\n    completed at any point, since objective $1$ has no prerequisite). Furthermore,\\n    using multiple cheats too close to each other can lead to\\n    unpredictable effects, so each objective can be involved in at\\n    most one use of a cheat. In other words, if you use a cheat on\\n    objective $i$ so that you\\n    can complete it before its prerequisite $P_ i$, then you can’t use a cheat on\\n    $P_ i$, nor on any other\\n    objective that has $i$ as\\n    a prerequisite.\\nCosmo would like to complete the game while exploiting at\\n    most $k$ cheats. In how\\n    many different orders can he complete all $n$ objectives, subject to these\\n    constraints? As this value can be very large, output it modulo\\n    $10^9+7$.\\nInput\\nThere will be up to 150 test cases in the input. Each test\\n    case will begin with two integers $n$ ($1\\n    \\\\le n \\\\le 200$) and $k$ ($0\\n    \\\\le k < n$), indicating the number of objectives\\n    Cosmo must complete ($n$)\\n    and the maximum number of cheats he’s willing to use\\n    ($k$). On the next line\\n    will be $n-1$\\n    space-separated integers $p$ ($1\\n    \\\\le p \\\\le n$), indicating the prerequisite objective for\\n    objectives $2, 3, \\\\ldots ,\\n    n$ (skipping $1$,\\n    since objective 1 has no prerequisite).

You had better fix\\n    things fast, or they will demote you to Tic-Tac-Toe\\n    recordkeeper!\\nCheckers (or English Draughts) is a well-known board game\\n    with simple rules. It is played on the dark squares of an\\n    $8\\\\times 8$ checkerboard.\\n    There are two players, Black and White, who alternate turns\\n    moving their pieces (all of Black’s pieces are black and all of\\n    White’s pieces are white). Each piece occupies a single dark\\n    square, and can be either a normal man or a promoted\\n    king. A turn consists of choosing one piece and moving\\n    it in one of two ways:\\n\\n\\nShifting it diagonally to an unoccupied adjacent dark\\n        square, as shown in Figure\\xa0a. This is called a\\n        simple move. If the piece is a man, it can move\\n        only in the two diagonal directions towards the opposing\\n        side of the board (towards the bottom for Black, the top\\n        for White). If the piece is a king, it can move in all four\\n        diagonal directions.\\n\\n\\nJumping over an adjacent enemy piece to an unoccupied\\n        square immediately on the other side, then removing\\n        (capturing) that piece. Men can jump only in the\\n        two directions described above, while kings can jump in all\\n        four. The player can then repeat this step, continuing to\\n        jump with the same piece as long as there are\\n        properly-positioned enemy pieces to capture. Such a\\n        sequence of one or more jumps is called a jump\\n        move.

Black sits at the top and White at the bottom.\\n          (c) Numbering used in the input.\\n        \\n\\n\\nIn Checkers, captures are forced moves. If a jump move is\\n    available at the start of a player’s turn, they must jump, and\\n    cannot stop jumping with that piece until it has no more\\n    possible jumps. They are free to choose which piece to jump\\n    with, and where, if there are multiple possibilities. In\\n    Figure\\xa0b, Black could not have made any other move.\\nIf a man reaches the farthest row from its player (that is,\\n    a black man reaches the bottom row or a white man reaches the\\n    top row), it is removed from the board and replaced by a king\\n    of the same color (it is said to be promoted), and the\\n    turn ends. A piece cannot be promoted and then jump backwards\\n    as a new king in the same turn.\\nGiven a list of moves, find a setup of pieces such that the\\n    moves can be legally played in sequence starting from that\\n    setup. This setup may not have black men on the bottom row or\\n    white men on the top row, since they would have been promoted\\n    to kings already. You need only ensure that the rules above are\\n    obeyed; you do not need to ensure that this setup is reachable\\n    in a real game of Checkers.\\nInput\\nThe first line of input contains a character $c$ and an integer $n$, where $c \\\\in \\\\{ \\\\texttt{B}, \\\\texttt{W}\\\\} $\\n    indicates which player makes the first move (Black or White\\n    respectively) and $n$\\n    ($1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$) is the\\n    number of moves in the list.

But new challenges lie ahead:\\n    cutting Swiss cheese.\\n\\n    Swiss cheese such as Emmentaler has holes in it, and the\\n    holes may have different sizes. A slice with holes contains\\n    less cheese and has a lower weight than a slice without holes.\\n    So here is the challenge: cut a cheese with holes in it into\\n    slices of equal weight.\\nBy smart sonar techniques (the same techniques used to scan\\n    unborn babies and oil fields), it is possible to locate the\\n    holes in the cheese up to micrometer precision.

Therefore, the crew is also after a much more\\n    spectacular feat: As many as possible cheetahs sprinting on\\n    parallel tracks filmed together in one shot.\\n“No, that is impossible,” said the director. “We cannot\\n    squeeze those animals into some sort of a start box, as you\\n    probably imagine, and then open the box and make them run all\\n    at once.

This cluster receives several raw\\n    data streams from field sensors and assigns each stream to a\\n    processor. Each processor performs some real time processing on\\n    a data stream and immediately after its termination, produces a\\n    report using its OGU.\\nEach stream has an integer starting time $s$, an integer duration $d$ and a priority $p$.

See the text for an explanation.\\n        \\n\\n\\nConsider the circuit shown in Figure\\xa01, which we use\\n    for illustration. This circuit has four inputs (letters A\\n    through D on the left), each of which is either true or false.\\n    There are four ‘gates’ each of which is one of three types:\\n    AND, OR, or NOT. Each gate produces either a true or false\\n    value, depending on its inputs. The last gate (the OR on the\\n    right) produces the output of the entire circuit. We can write\\n    these three types of gates in text by their equivalent\\n    logical operators: * for AND, + for\\n    OR, and - for NOT. In what follows, we’ll use the\\n    operators rather than gates to describe circuits.\\nHere is how these operators work. Given an assignment of\\n    true (T) or false (F) for each input, the\\n    operators produce the truth value indicated in the following\\n    tables:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\n\\n\\nB\\n\\n\\nA B *\\n\\n\\nA B +\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\n\\u2003\\n      \\n\\n\\nA\\n\\n\\nA -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotice that AND and OR take two inputs, whereas NOT operates\\n    on only one input. Also, we use postfix notation to\\n    write expressions involving operators (like $\\\\verb|A B *|$), where the operator\\n    comes after its input(s) (just as how in\\n    Figure\\xa01, each gate in the circuit diagram comes after its\\n    inputs).\\nWhen we describe a valid circuit in postfix notation, we use\\n    the following syntax.\\n\\n\\nAn uppercase letter (A through Z) is a\\n        valid circuit. In other words, an input alone (without any\\n        gates) is a valid circuit (which produces as output its own\\n        input value).\\n\\n\\nIf <C1> and <C2> are valid\\n        circuits, then ‘<C1> <C2> *’ is a\\n        valid circuit that produces the AND of the outputs of the\\n        two subcircuits.\\n\\n\\nIf <C1> and <C2> are valid\\n        circuits, then ‘<C1> <C2> +’ is a\\n        valid circuit that produces the OR of the outputs of the\\n        two subcircuits.\\n\\n\\nIf <C1> is a valid circuit, then\\n        ‘<C1> -’ is a valid circuit that produces\\n        the NOT of <C1>’s output.\\n\\n\\nNo other description is a valid circuit.\\nThus, one of the ways the circuit in Figure 1 could be\\n    described using postfix notation is as the string:\\n\\nA B * C D + - +\\n\\nGiven a truth value (T or F) for each of\\n    the inputs (A, B, C, and D\\n    in this example), their values propagate through the gates of\\n    the circuit, and the truth value produced by the last gate is\\n    the output of the circuit. For example, when the above circuit\\n    is given inputs A=T, B=F, C=T,\\n    D=F, the output of the circuit is F.\\nGiven an assignment to variables and a circuit description,\\n    your software should print the output of the circuit.\\nInput\\nThe first line of the input consists of a single integer\\n    $n$, satisfying\\n    $1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 26$,\\n    denoting the number of input variables.

Of course, he could just have chosen a\\n    combination lock, but as there were far too many numbers flying\\n    around in his daily thoughts, this idea was indeed a poor one.\\n    What he needed, was a lock which could be deactivated by\\n    solving a mathematical problem. For this type of lock, he could\\n    always be certain to have the “key” on him. However, for the\\n    sake of safety, the problem had to be hard enough for anyone\\n    trying to find the solution merely by testing all\\n    possibilities. Still, if you knew the mathematics behind the\\n    lock, you should be able to deactivate it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Pressing the increaser buttons of row 2\\n          once, and column 2 twice, deactivates the lock.\\n        \\n\\n\\nBeing a big fan of modular arithmetic, Bolkás designed the\\n    lock as a $2 \\\\times 2$\\n    array of four modular devices (cf.\\xa0fig.\\xa01). A modular\\n    device is a discrete counter with a display showing the current\\n    state of the counter, and a trigger. Each counter can be in any\\n    of the states $0, 1, \\\\ldots ,\\n    p-1$, where $p \\\\ge\\n    1$ is the period of the counter. By trigging a counter,\\n    the state of the counter changes from $i$ to $i+1$, except when the state is\\n    $p-1$, in which case the\\n    new state is $0$. For each\\n    row and each column of the array, the professor put an\\n    increaser button on the panel of the lock. By pushing the\\n    increaser button for a row or column, both counters in that row\\n    or column are trigged. The lock is deactivated exactly when all\\n    four modular devices are in state $0$. Bolkás also added a mechanism to\\n    activate the lock. Upon locking, each modular device is put in\\n    a randomly chosen state, not all equal to $0$ (since in that case the lock would\\n    be immediately deactivated). Sadly enough, the professor soon\\n    found that for some quadruples of periods, it sometimes\\n    happened that the lock was put in a combination of states such\\n    that it could not be deactivated! However, it did not take him\\n    long to find an interesting relation between the locks, which\\n    helped him, and hopefully you, to decide if a lock could be\\n    deactivated or not: He observed that a lock whose modular\\n    devices had the periods $p_{11}$, $p_{12}$, $p_{21}$ and $p_{22}$, and were put in the states\\n    $s_{11}$, $s_{12}$, $s_{21}$ and $s_{22}$, could be deactivated if\\n    and only if a lock with all modular devices having the\\n    same period $p = \\\\gcd (p_{11},\\n    p_{12}, p_{21}, p_{22})$ and the states $s’_{ij} = s_{ij} \\\\bmod p$, could.

       " 'citrusintern': 'CC0, kmicican via Pixabay\\n\\n\\nThe summer is closing in and you have set your eyes on a\\n    summer internship with your favourite fruit confederacy,\\n    Citrus. What you really want is to take over the\\n    entire organisation on your way to world fruit domination, but\\n    getting an internship is a nice first step.\\nYou know that there is a single person in Citrus deciding\\n    who gets the internship, but unfortunately, you don’t know who\\n    that person is. Thus, you decide to infiltrate the entire\\n    organization by bribing some subset of members, so that you are\\n    guaranteed to get the internship. You have already gathered the\\n    organization map, as well as estimated the amount of money each\\n    member would require to aid your candidacy. The only thing\\n    remaining is deciding who to recruit.\\nWhen you bribe a Citrus member, that member will be able to\\n    manipulate both their superior as well as their direct\\n    subordinates to support your candidacy. In this way it is not\\n    necessary to bribe everyone in Citrus, as long as everyone in\\n    the organisation is either bribed or manipulated by someone who\\n    is.\\nIn addition, you want to take an extra precaution. You do\\n    not want two different people to both be bribed if they ever\\n    talk to each other; then they might realize what your final\\n    plan is, and start blackmailing you. Citrus protocol dictates\\n    that nobody should ever discuss anything with anyone who is not\\n    their immediate boss or subordinate, so you figure your scheme\\n    will be sufficiently safe as long as you avoid bribing the\\n    immediate superior of someone else you bribe.\\nTo initiate the infiltration you are to write a program that\\n    given the organizational map of Citrus as well as the cost of\\n    recruiting each of its members, outputs the minimum amount of\\n    money required to complete the task. Because Citrus is so\\n    well-organized, every member has exactly one immediate\\n    supervisor, except the one and only most sour\\n    excellence, who has only subordinates.\\nInput\\nThe first line consists of an integer $1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 100\\\\, 000$, the number\\n    of members in Citrus. Then follows $N$ lines, each describing a member,\\n    beginning with member $0$\\n    and ending with member $N-1$.

Then follows $U_\\n    i$ numbers on the same line, the identification numbers\\n    of the subordinates. Note that all identification numbers are\\n    between $0$ and\\n    $N-1$.\\nOutput\\nThe minimum cost of infiltrating the entire organization\\n    while adhering to the restrictions above.

       " 'cleaningpipes': 'Picture of sink hole by Ogar93 via Wikimedia\\n        Commons\\n\\nLinköping has a quite complex water transport system.\\n    Around Linköping there are several wells from which water is\\n    drawn. The water is then transported to other locations using\\n    pipes. Each pipe is a straight canal from one of the wells to\\n    some location in the city.\\n\\n    All the pipes are at the same depth under ground. Therefore,\\n    whenever two pipes cross, they form an intersection. Luckily\\n    the pipe system was constructed in such a way that exactly two\\n    pipes meet at each such intersection. The wells do not count as\\n    intersections. Any number of pipes (including zero or more than\\n    two) may originate at each well.\\nThe intersections pose a problem, since dirt (a mixture of\\n    lime and other “remains”) tends to get stuck there. This dirt\\n    causes the pipes to degrade and collapse, leading to the\\n    formation of large sink holes. Such sink holes have a\\n    mesmerising effect on the students in Linköping, causing them\\n    to neglect their studies and remain uneducated, which in the\\n    long run will lead to a collapse of not just the pipe system\\n    but of the very fabric of society. Therefore it is imperative\\n    that the pipes are regularly cleaned. The Nordic Water\\n    Extraction and Redistribution Company (NWERC) – which is in\\n    charge of Linköping’s waterpipes – has an ample fleet of robots\\n    to perform this task. A robot can be inserted into a pipe at\\n    the well where the pipe begins. The robot then goes through the\\n    pipe all the way to its end and cleans all intersections along\\n    the way. After reaching the end, the robot turns around and\\n    returns back to the well where it started. In order to prevent\\n    robot collisions, government regulations stipulate that\\n    whenever two pipes intersect, at most one of them may contain a\\n    robot.\\nSince the whole water system has to be shut down while it is\\n    being cleaned (another government regulation), the NWERC would\\n    like to do the cleaning quickly, by using a single batch of\\n    cleaning robots, all started at the same time.\\nYour task is to verify whether this can be done – i.e.,\\n    whether we can simultaneously insert robots into a subset of\\n    the pipes in such a way that the robots will clean all\\n    intersections and there will be no risk of two robots\\n    colliding.\\nInput\\nThe input consists of:\\n\\n\\none line with two integers $w$ ($1 \\\\le w \\\\le 1\\\\, 000$), the number\\n        of wells, and $p$\\n        ($1 \\\\le p \\\\le 1\\\\,\\n        000$), the number of pipes;\\n\\n\\n$w$ lines, the\\n        $i$th of which\\n        contains two integers $x_\\n        i$ and $y_ i$\\n        ($-10\\\\, 000 \\\\le x, y \\\\le 10\\\\,\\n        000$), the position of well number $i$ (the wells are numbered from\\n        $1$ to $w$);\\n\\n\\n$p$ lines each with\\n        three integers $s$\\n        ($1 \\\\le s \\\\leq w$),\\n        the well at which the pipe starts, and $x$ and $y$ ($-10\\\\, 000 \\\\le x, y \\\\le 10\\\\,\\n        000$), the position at which the pipe ends.\\n\\n\\nEach pipe will contain exactly one well, the one at which it\\n    starts.

       " 'cliffwalk': 'Image from Nuala\\n\\n\\nOne morning last summer, Charlotte was watching the moon and\\n    the sun and observed that the moon was full. As she lives along\\n    the Atlantic coast she knows that this means a larger variation\\n    in the tide compared to first and last quarter. With no rain in\\n    the air, it seemed like a perfect week for walks at the beach\\n    by the cliffs.\\nThe tide is dangerous when walking at the beach between the\\n    sea and the cliff wall. As the water rises, you may get\\n    trapped. Therefore it is important to plan the walk according\\n    to the behaviour of the tide.\\nOne simple way of cliff walk planning is just to start\\n    walking and turn around at low tide. The problem is that on a\\n    rocky beach, you want the rocks to dry for one hour before\\n    entering them. It could therefore actually be safe to continue\\n    the walk a bit further even after low tide. Note that the beach\\n    is mostly made of sand and the rocks have many cracks in them,\\n    so we assume that all areas are flooded or drained at the exact\\n    moment when the tide reaches their height, irrespective of the\\n    heights of the neighbouring areas.\\nThe beach has been surveyed and a map is available where\\n    each $10\\\\times 10$m square\\n    has a certain height. Each square can only be entered from the\\n    four neighbouring squares to the north, south, east and west.\\n    It is only possible to pass between two squares of height\\n    $z_1, z_2$ if the absolute\\n    height difference $|z_1 -\\n    z_2|$ is at most $1$ meter. Charlotte walks in such a\\n    way that it takes a constant amount of time to pass from one\\n    square to another and during the whole time period both squares\\n    must be dry.\\nThe tide behaves differently at different places on the\\n    Earth depending on the sea bottom, coast line etc. Charlotte\\n    knows that it is possible to approximate the tide’s water level\\n    $v$ as $v = 0.5a\\\\cdot (\\\\cos (t\\\\frac{2\\\\pi\\n    }{12})+1)$, where $t$ is time in hours since the last\\n    high tide and $a$ is a\\n    number depending on the location, time of the year, etc.\\nCharlotte will start and finish her walk at her home. She\\n    limits her time away from home to only one tide interval, so\\n    you may assume that $0.0 \\\\leq t\\n    \\\\leq 12.0$. How far from home is she able to get and\\n    still return safely back?\\nInput\\nThe first line of the input contains two floating point\\n    numbers $a$, $0.0 < a < 15.0$, and\\n    $m$, $0.1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 60.0$, the number of\\n    seconds it takes to pass one square on the map. The second line\\n    contains four integers $W$, $H$, $X$ and $Y$ where $1 \\\\le W,H \\\\le 200$, $0 \\\\le X < W$ and $0 \\\\le Y < H$. $W$ and $H$ are the width and height of the\\n    map of the coast, $X$ and\\n    $Y$ describes the\\n    coordinate $(X, Y)$ of\\n    Charlotte’s home.\\nThen follow $H$ lines\\n    each containing $W$ space\\n    separated integers, describing the height in millimetres of\\n    each $10\\\\times 10$m\\n    surveyed square compared to extreme low tide. You can assume\\n    that the height of each square will be at least $0$ and at most $20\\\\, 000$ milimetres. The first\\n    number on the first line corresponds to coordinate $(0, 0)$. Charlotte’s home will always\\n    be dry.\\nOutput\\nOutput one line with the maximum Euclidean distance that\\n    Charlotte can get from home. The distance between two squares\\n    should be measured between their centers. The answer is\\n    considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error of\\n    at most $10^{-6}$.\\nTo avoid problems with floating point numbers, the result is\\n    guaranteed to be the same for all walking speeds $m’$ where $0.999 m < m’ < 1.001 m$.\\n\\n\\nSample Input 1\\nSample Output 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.0 10.0\\n3 3 0 0\\n2001 1000 100\\n1001 10000 200\\n100 0 0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Input 2\\nSample Output 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.0 30.0\\n6 2 2 0\\n73 1001 4001 1001 76 70\\n70 2001 3001 2001 72 71\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n22.36067977',\n",
       " 'climbing': 'Picture by Graham\\n        Evans\\n\\n\\nFiona is an expert climber. She often brings some pegs with\\n    her, which she nails in some strategic places in the rock wall,\\n    so that less experienced climbers can use them for support.\\n    Fiona can climb to anywhere in the wall, but hammering a peg\\n    needs some balance, so she can only place a peg if she is\\n    standing in currently placed pegs (or, of course, the floor).\\n    She can remove a peg at any time and reuse it later. For each\\n    wall she is planning to visit, she has a careful plan for how\\n    to place and remove pegs in such a way that every strategic\\n    point has a peg at some step.\\nYesterday it was raining, so the rock will be wet and it can\\n    be unsafe to remove pegs. Because of this, Fiona will only\\n    remove a peg $p$ if she\\n    can stand on the same pegs as when $p$ was placed. Alas Fiona’s existing\\n    plans do not take this new precaution into account, so Fiona\\n    has to update her plans and she has asked you for help. She\\n    would like not to carry too many extra pegs, so you promised to\\n    find safe plans using at most $10$ times more pegs than her previous\\n    plans were using. Can you deliver on your promise?\\nFor example, consider the wall in the first sample input\\n    with $5$ strategic points.\\n    Point $1$ is close to the\\n    ground so it does not depend on any point. There has to be a\\n    peg in point $1$ in order\\n    to put a peg in point $2$,\\n    and the same holds for point $3$. In order to put a peg in point\\n    $4$, there has to be a peg\\n    both in point $2$ and\\n    point $3$. To put a peg in\\n    point $5$ it is enough if\\n    there is a peg at point $4$.\\nTherefore, the sequence (with annotations $+$ and $-$ depending on whether we add or\\n    remove a peg) $+1,+2,+3,-1,+4,-2,-3,+5$ is a safe\\n    dry plan, and it uses $3$\\n    pegs. However it is not a safe wet plan, because we remove the\\n    pegs at points $2$ and\\n    $3$ without support. The\\n    sequence $+1,+2,-2,+3,-1,+4,-3,+5$ only\\n    requires $2$ pegs, but it\\n    is not safe at all because we add a peg to point $4$ without there being a peg at point\\n    $2$. The sequence\\n    $+1,+2,+3,-1,+4,+5$ is a\\n    safe wet plan, and it uses $4$ pegs.\\nInput\\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($1\\n    \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1\\\\, 000$), the number of strategic points in\\n    a wall. Each of the following $n$ lines contains an integer\\n    $p$ ($0 \\\\leq p < n$) and a list of\\n    $p$ integers. If line\\n    $i$ contains $x_1,\\\\ldots ,x_ p$ ($1 \\\\leq x_ j < i$), then all points\\n    $x_ j$ need to have a peg\\n    in order to place a peg in point $i$.\\nThe next line contains an integer $t$ ($1\\n    \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1\\\\, 000$), the number of steps in the safe\\n    dry plan. Each of the following $t$ lines contains an integer\\n    $i$, meaning that a peg is\\n    being placed or removed from point $i$.\\nOutput\\nIf there is no safe wet plan using at most $10$ times the number of pegs of the\\n    safe dry plan, output $-1$.

The\\n    object of the game is to determine who murdered Mr.\\xa0Body,\\n    which weapon was used to murder him, and where the murder took\\n    place. The game uses a set of cards representing six persons\\n    (labeled A, B, …, F), six weapons (labeled G, H, …, L) and nine\\n    rooms (labeled M, N, …, U). At the start of the game, one\\n    person card, one weapon card, and one room card are selected at\\n    random and removed from the deck so no one can see them – they\\n    represent the murderer, the murder weapon, and the murder\\n    location. The remaining $18$ cards are shuffled and dealt to\\n    the players, starting with player $1$, then to her right player\\n    $2$, and so on. Some\\n    players may end up with one more card than others. For the\\n    purposes of this problem there are four players, so the person\\n    to the right of player $4$\\n    is player $1$.\\nThe rest of the game is spent searching for clues. Players\\n    take turns, starting with player 1 and moving to the right. A\\n    turn consists of making a suggestion (consisting of a\\n    murder suspect, a weapon, and a room) and asking other players\\n    if they have any evidence that refutes the suggestion. For\\n    example, you might say to another player “I believe the\\n    murderer was person A, using weapon L, in room T.” If the other\\n    player is holding exactly one of these cards, that player must\\n    show you (and only you) that card. If they have more than one\\n    such card, they can show you any one of them.\\nWhen making a suggestion, you must first ask the person to\\n    your right for any evidence. If they have none, you continue\\n    with the person on their right, and so on, until someone has\\n    evidence, or no one has any of the cards in your\\n    suggestion.\\nMany times you can gain information even if you are not the\\n    person making the suggestion. Suppose, in the above example,\\n    you are the third player and have cards A and T. If someone\\n    else shows evidence to the suggester, you know that it must be\\n    weapon card L.

Needless to say, you want to be absolutely\\n    sure of your accusation before you make it.\\nHere is your problem. You are player $1$. Given a set of cards dealt to you\\n    and a history of suggestions and evidence, you need to decide\\n    how close you are to being able to make an accusation.\\nInput\\nThe input starts with an integer $n$ ($1\\n    \\\\le n \\\\le 50$), the number of suggestions made during\\n    the game.

If a player presents no evidence, a\\n    ‘-’ (dash) is listed; otherwise an\\n    “evidence character” is listed. If the specific evidence card\\n    is seen by you (either because you provided it or you were the\\n    person receiving the evidence) then the evidence character\\n    identifies that card; otherwise the evidence character is\\n    ‘*’.

The idea was that all\\n    developers should make sure that every code change they push to\\n    the master branch of their software repository strictly follows\\n    the coding guidelines. After all, one of the developers,\\n    Perikles, has been doing this since long before these\\n    regulations became effective so how hard could it be?\\n    Rather than investing a lot of time figuring out why this\\n    degradation in productivity occurred, the line manager suggests\\n    that they loosen their requirement: developers can push code\\n    that weakly violates the guidelines as long as they run cleanup\\n    phases on the code from time to time to make sure the\\n    repository is tidy.\\nShe suggests a metric where the “dirtiness” of a developer’s\\n    code is the sum of the pushes that violate the guidelines –\\n    so-called dirty pushes – made by that developer, each\\n    weighted by the number of days since it was pushed. The number\\n    of days since a dirty push is a step function that increases by\\n    one each midnight following the push. Hence, if a developer has\\n    made dirty pushes on days $1$, $2$, and $5$, the dirtiness on day $6$ is $5+4+1=10$.

Still,\\n    she wants to run the cleanup phase as seldomly as possible, and\\n    always postpones it until it is absolutely necessary.

When a Codename\\n    card is pointed out, the spymaster reveals the identity of that\\n    card—a blue agent card, a red agent card, an innocent bystander\\n    card, or the assassin card.

       " 'codes': 'Error correcting codes are used in a wide variety of\\n    applications ranging from satellite communication to music CDs.\\n    The idea is to encode a binary string of length $k$ as a binary string of length\\n    $n>k$, called a\\n    codeword, in such a way that even if some bit(s) of\\n    the encoding are corrupted (if you scratch on your CD for\\n    instance), the original $k$-bit string can still be recovered.\\n    There are three important parameters associated with an error\\n    correcting code: the length of codewords ($n$), the dimension\\n    ($k$) which is the length\\n    of the unencoded strings, and finally the minimum\\n    distance ($d$) of the\\n    code.\\nDistance between two codewords is measured as Hamming\\n    distance, i.e., the number of positions in which the codewords\\n    differ: $0010$ and\\n    $0100$ are at distance\\n    $2$. The minimum distance\\n    of the code is the distance between the two different codewords\\n    that are closest to each other.\\nLinear codes are a simple type of error correcting codes\\n    with several nice properties. One of them is that the minimum\\n    distance is the smallest distance any non-zero codeword has to\\n    the zero codeword (the codeword consisting of $n$ zeros always belongs to a linear\\n    code of length $n$).\\nAnother nice property of linear codes of length $n$ and dimension $k$ is that they can be described by\\n    an $n\\\\times k$ generator\\n    matrix of zeros and ones. Encoding a $k$-bit string is done by viewing it\\n    as a column vector and multiplying it by the generator matrix.\\n    The example below shows a generator matrix and how the string\\n    $1001$ is\\n    encoded.\\\\[ \\\\left(\\n    \\\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 1\\n    & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 &\\n    0 & 1 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 1\\n    & 1 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{array} \\\\right)\\n    \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\end{array}\\\\right) =\\n    \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\ 1\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\ 0\\n    \\\\end{array}\\\\right) \\\\]\\nMatrix multiplication is done as usual except that addition\\n    is done modulo\\xa0$2$\\n    (i.e., $0+1=1+0=1$ and\\n    $0+0=1+1=0$).

Due to an unfortunate combination of\\n    over-consumption, natural climate variations, and generally\\n    difficult conditions, the island of Incunabula has run out of\\n    trees. Because several other Insumulian islands depended on\\n    trees from Incunabula through trade, its collapse will have\\n    repercussions all over Insumulia. In this problem, we’ll\\n    simulate a (highly oversimplified) model of the situation to\\n    determine the effects of the collapse of Incunabula.\\n\\n    We model the situation as follows. Each island has a\\n    threshold $T_ i$\\n    on the amount of incoming goods (for simplicity we assume that\\n    there is only a single commodity of goods) it needs to receive\\n    per lunar cycle in order for the society of the island to\\n    sustain itself. If the amount of incoming goods drops below the\\n    threshold, society on the island will collapse and die out, and\\n    the island will no longer provide goods to other islands,\\n    thereby potentially causing them to collapse as well.

She has also spent her whole life studying\\n    biological colour perception and the physical properties of\\n    colour: retinas, cones, wavelengths, and so on. She knows all\\n    there is to know, quantifiably, about colour. But if Mary\\n    finally leaves the room and experiences seeing colour for the\\n    first time, would she learn anything new about colour?\\nThis is a well-known argument against a philosophical\\n    position called physicalism, but you don’t have to worry about\\n    arguing with philosophers while working on this problem.\\n    Instead, you have been contacted by Mary, who has just received\\n    word that she will be permitted to leave her room for a single\\n    day this year (the experimenters behind Mary’s Room were\\n    getting a bit worried about the newly formed Thought Experiment\\n    Ethics Review Board).\\nBecause of hypothetical travel restrictions, Mary is limited\\n    to visiting places in her local region. The experimenters have\\n    kindly obtained and provided you with a list of all the\\n    potential locations she can travel to and the colours\\n    associated with each location. Since she has just one day to\\n    explore, she only has time to visit at most $V$ of the locations.\\nThe experimenters have also decided to give Mary a special\\n    experimental camera designed to take black and white\\n    photographs with a single accent colour. (They have begun\\n    planning a missing-shade-of-blue experiment for when Mary\\n    returns to her room again.) Note that the camera can always be\\n    recalibrated between photographs to capture a different accent\\n    colour. However, since the camera was developed by die-hard\\n    film photographers, the number of photographs one can take with\\n    it is limited by the sizes of rolls of film. Mary must use a\\n    different roll of film at each location, which means that she\\n    can take at most $R$\\n    photos (and therefore can capture at most $R$ distinct colours) at each\\n    location.\\nMary would like to capture as many colours as possible, but\\n    she isn’t sure how best to do this, so she has requested that\\n    you provide her with an itinerary which maximizes the total\\n    number of distinct colours she can capture in one day.\\nInput\\nThe first line of input contains three space-separated\\n    integers, $L$,\\n    $V$, and $R$, where $L$ is the total number of locations\\n    in Mary’s local region $(1 \\\\leq L\\n    \\\\leq 10)$, $V$ is\\n    the number of locations Mary has time to visit $(1 \\\\leq V \\\\leq L)$, and $R$ is the maximum number of photos\\n    Mary can take at each location $(1 \\\\leq R \\\\leq 36)$.\\n$L$ lines follow.

Also, none of the dots\\n    touch the outer boundary of the page, and the instructions are\\n    written in a kind of invisible ink that ensures they do not\\n    interfere with the drawing or colouring processes in any way\\n    (and yet are still readable).\\nMTA’s executives would like to determine how fun the\\n    colouring book is going to be.

Many people, even\\n    the English, will, in practice, ignore them, and, apply custom\\n    rules, or, no rules, at all. Doctor Comma Sprinkler solved this\\n    issue by developing a set of rules that sprinkles commas in a\\n    sentence with no ambiguity and little simplicity. In this\\n    problem you will help Dr.\\xa0Sprinkler by producing an\\n    algorithm to automatically apply her rules.\\nDr.\\xa0Sprinkler’s rules for adding commas to an existing\\n    piece of text are as follows:\\n\\n\\nIf a word anywhere in the text is preceded by a comma,\\n        find all occurrences of that word in the text, and put a\\n        comma before each of those occurrences, except in the case\\n        where such an occurrence is the first word of a sentence or\\n        already preceded by a comma.\\n\\n\\nIf a word anywhere in the text is succeeded by a comma,\\n        find all occurrences of that word in the text, and put a\\n        comma after each of those occurrences, except in the case\\n        where such an occurrence is the last word of a sentence or\\n        already succeeded by a comma.\\n\\n\\nApply rules\\xa0$1$ and\\xa0$2$ repeatedly until no new commas\\n        can be added using either of them.\\n\\n\\nAs an example, consider the text\\n\\nplease sit spot. sit spot, sit. spot here now here.\\n\\nBecause there is a comma after spot in\\n    the second sentence, a comma should be added after spot in the third sentence as well (but not the first\\n    sentence, since it is the last word of that sentence). Also,\\n    because there is a comma before the word sit in the second sentence, one should be added\\n    before that word in the first sentence (but no comma is added\\n    before the word sit beginning the second\\n    sentence because it is the first word of that sentence).\\n    Finally, notice that once a comma is added after spot in the third sentence, there exists a comma\\n    before the first occurrence of the word here.

The racers compete by going down a\\n    mountain on a set of roads. As it would be dangerous to have\\n    cars speeding at each other in opposite directions, racers may\\n    only drive downhill on each road in a single direction. The\\n    endpoint of each road is called a station, and roads connect\\n    only at stations.\\nA path is a sequence of roads where the ending station of\\n    one road is the starting station of the next. Each racer must\\n    choose a path to race on. The length of a path is the number of\\n    roads in it.\\nThe goal of this race is to stay on the course as long as\\n    possible – that is, to find a path of maximum length. Every\\n    racer knows the full layout of the stations and roads, and will\\n    choose some path of maximal length.\\nFiliberto is concerned about natural disasters (e.g.,\\n    landslides) blocking off roads during the competition. If a\\n    road is blocked off, it may reduce the length of some paths of\\n    the race. This works as follows: say the road from station\\n    $u$ to station\\n    $v$ is blocked off. Then\\n    the racer will follow their path until station $u$, at which point they have to\\n    modify their path starting from station $u$, while still trying to maximize\\n    the length of their new path. As each racer knows the full map\\n    of the mountain, they will optimally re-route to maximize the\\n    length of their new path.\\nTo understand the worst-case scenario, Filiberto wants to\\n    know the minimum length path that a winning racer would take if\\n    at most one of the roads is blocked off. This means that among\\n    all sets of maximum length paths that racers can choose and all\\n    possible roads that can be blocked off, what is the minimum\\n    length path that a racer may take after that road is blocked\\n    off and that path is at least as long as any other racers’ path\\n    (other racers are also effected by the same blocked road)?\\nInput\\nThe first line of the input contains two integers\\n    $n$ and $m$ $(2\\n    \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5, 1 \\\\le m \\\\le \\\\min (n(n-1)/2, 10^6))$ –\\n    the number of stations and number of roads on the mountain. The\\n    next $m$ lines each\\n    contain two integers $u$\\n    and $v$ $(1 \\\\le u,v \\\\le n, u \\\\ne v)$\\n    representing a one-way road from station $u$ to station $v$. It is guaranteed that there is at\\n    most one road between any pair of stations and there are no\\n    loops in the road graph (i.e. the input is a directed acyclic\\n    graph).\\nOutput\\nPrint a line with a single integer – the minimum length path\\n    that competitors can achieve if at most one of the roads is\\n    blocked off. That is, Filiberto wants to know the minimum\\n    longest time with the worst landslide location.\\nSample Explanation\\nIn the second sample, every racer will start from stations\\n    number $1$ or $7$. If the road $(2, 3)$ is blocked, then all racers\\n    will have to re-route at station $2$ towards station $5$.\\nIn the third sample, the minimum path that could be taken\\n    happens by blocking the first road of the only path that racers\\n    can choose. Blocking any other road results in a longer\\n    path.\\nIn the last sample there is only one maximum length path,\\n    but the best option is to block the road $(4, 5)$. If we block the road\\n    $(1, 4)$ the racers can\\n    re-route earlier and achieve a path of length $2$.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSample $2$\\n\\n\\nSample $3$\\n\\n\\nSample $4$\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Input 1\\nSample Output 1\\n\\n\\n\\n4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n3 4\\n2 4\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Input 2\\nSample Output 2\\n\\n\\n\\n7 6\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n2 5\\n6 3\\n7 2\\n3 4\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Input 3\\nSample Output 3\\n\\n\\n\\n7 5\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n5 6\\n6 7\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Input 4\\nSample Output 4\\n\\n\\n\\n6 5\\n1 2\\n1 4\\n2 3\\n4 5\\n5 6\\n\\n\\n\\n1',\n",

Bash needs to\\n    communicate this strategy to Chikapu. Let’s denote this\\n    sequence as $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\\\ldots\\n    , A_{n}$ $(1 \\\\le A_{i} \\\\le\\n    10^9)$.\\nFirst, Bash gives Chikapu the integer $n$. Then Chikapu can ask Bash\\n    multiple questions about the sequence. Bash answers each\\n    question immediately, before Chikapu asks another question. For\\n    each question Chikapu gives Bash $2$ indices $l$ and $r$ $(1\\n    \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq n)$. Bash then selects an arbitrary\\n    integer $k$ $(1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq r - l + 1)$, and\\n    considers all subsets of size $k$ of the sequence $a_{l}, a_{l+1}, \\\\ldots , a_{r}$\\n    (there are ${r-l+1}\\\\choose\\n    {k}$ such subsets).

Your goal is to\\n    “catch” the AI’s piece, that is, one (or both) of your pieces\\n    has to lie in the same cell as the AI’s piece after one of your\\n    turns. When this happens, you win and the game ends. You lose\\n    if you have not won after 600 turns.\\nEach turn, you have up to five movement options per piece:\\n    You can move a piece up, down, left, or right to an adjacent\\n    cell (if there is one) or let the piece remain in its current\\n    cell.

This\\n    interaction must follow a specific protocol:\\nYour submission and the grader alternate writing turns, with\\n    you going first.

Similarly, the grader will\\n    send lines with two integers $x,y$ to indicate the AI’s turn. You\\n    can safely assume that the grader will only send you valid\\n    moves, and the AI will never choose to place its piece in a\\n    cell occupied by one or both of your pieces. Your submission\\n    may take at most $600$\\n    turns.\\nAfter each of your turns you should flush the\\n    standard output to ensure that the request is sent to the\\n    grader. For example, you can use fflush(stdout) in C++, System.out.flush() in Java and sys.stdout.flush() in Python.\\nAfter you send the grader a valid turn catching the AI’s\\n    piece, the game ends. Your submission should then terminate\\n    with exit code 0 as usual.

Furthermore, the candy types have different\\n    weights (though some may weigh the same), and in order to\\n    simplify pricing matters, the ACM wants all candy boxes to have\\n    the same total weight.\\nWith these restrictions, the ACM will only be able to make a\\n    limited number of boxes.

       " 'contentprotection': 'Dan is working for a digital content protection company,\\n    which is responsible for the content protection of blu-ray\\n    discs based on a standard called Anti Content Misuse (ACM).\\nThe ACM standard works as follows. Assume there are\\n    $2^ n$ blu-ray\\n    drives/players. We represent these $2^ n$ drives as the leaves of a\\n    complete binary tree of height $n$, so that each root-to-leaf path\\n    consists of $n$ edges.\\n    Each node $u$ in this\\n    binary tree is assigned an identifier number and contains a\\n    random key $k_ u$. The\\n    identifier numbers are assigned as follows. The root,\\n    $r$, is assigned\\n    $1$. In addition, the left\\n    and right children of an internal node having number\\n    $i$ are assigned numbers\\n    $2i$ and $2i+1$, respectively. This scheme\\n    assigns a distinct number to each node in the tree. The keys\\n    contained in the nodes are unknown to blu-ray users, but they\\n    are available to blu-ray drive manufacturers. Each blu-ray\\n    player is assigned the identifier number $i$ ($2^\\n    n \\\\le i \\\\le 2^{n+1}-1$) of its corresponding leaf in the\\n    tree. A manufacturer of blu-ray drives embeds the keys\\n    associated with the nodes in the path from the root to leaf\\n    number $i$ in player\\n    number $i$.\\nTo encrypt the content of a blu-ray disc, the company in\\n    charge creates a random key $k$ called the master key. First, they\\n    encrypt $k$ with the key\\n    $k_ r$ (recall\\n    $r$ is the root node of\\n    binary tree) and write it on the disc as a header. Then, they\\n    encrypt the content with $k$, and write the encrypted data on\\n    the blu-ray disc. A blu-ray drive first decrypts the header\\n    using key $k_ r$ embedded\\n    in it and recovers the master key $k$ and then, decrypts the content\\n    using the key $k$.\\nUnfortunately, the keys embedded in a set of blu-ray drives,\\n    $R$, are exposed by\\n    hackers and published on the web. As a result, we cannot\\n    encrypt the master key $k$\\n    using any of these exposed keys. For example, since all blu-ray\\n    drives contain $k_ r$, the\\n    encryption scheme above does not work any more. There is a\\n    solution oversaw for this situation in the ACM standard. At the\\n    cost of a larger header, the industry can safely encrypt the\\n    content of a new blu-ray disc. They carefully choose a subset\\n    of unexposed keys $K$ in\\n    the binary tree such that all blu-ray drives, except for drives\\n    in $R$, have at least one\\n    of the keys in $K$. They\\n    encrypt the master key $k$\\n    with each key $k’ \\\\in K$\\n    and put the result in the header (i.e., there are $|K|$ ciphertexts in the header). Now,\\n    each active blu-ray drive can decrypt at least one of the\\n    ciphertexts in the header and can recover the master key\\n    $k$.

       " 'cool1': 'You are the boss of ACM\\n    (Association for Cool Machineries), an upstanding company with\\n    a single goal of world domination.\\nLike all other world domination oriented villains, you dream\\n    of having a gigantic evil robot doing evil deeds. I mean, is\\n    there anyone who can resist the urge of having your own\\n    personal gigantic laser-firing robot? Thus, it is to your\\n    ultimate joy when the scientific committee of ACM told you about their success in inventing\\n    a prototype for the GL-bot (shorthand for Giant Laser\\n    Robot).\\nAs a demonstration, they have placed GL-bot on a field\\n    modeled as an $N \\\\times N$\\n    grid. Each cell in the grid is either empty or impassable. All\\n    cells on the borders of the grid are impassable. GL-bot is\\n    initially located on one of these empty cells.\\nThe GL-bot’s behavior is programmed with a string of length\\n    at most $N$. Each\\n    character in the string is either <, >,\\n    ^, or v,\\n    denoting four directions of movement. GL-bot will continuously\\n    move on the grid according to this string. The movement works\\n    as follows. GL-bot considers the characters in the string one\\n    by one, starting from the first character until the last\\n    character, and then loop back to the first character and\\n    repeat. GL-bot performs a movement depending on the character\\n    being considered (for the images below, black cells denote\\n    impassable cells, while white cells denote empty cells):\\n\\n\\n<: GL-bot moves to the left\\n        one step, if able.\\n\\n\\n\\n>: GL-bot moves to the\\n        right one step, if able.\\n\\n\\n\\nv: GL-bot moves down one step,\\n        if able.\\n\\n\\n\\n^: GL-bot moves up one step,\\n        if able.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore specifically, GL-bot moves one cell from its current\\n    location to the location as determined by the character.\\n    However, if the new location is impassable, the robot does not\\n    perform the move, and this movement is skipped. GL-bot then\\n    considers the next character in the program.\\nThe trail of GL-bot is the (possibly infinite) sequence of\\n    (possibly non-distinct) cells of the grid that GL-bot traverses\\n    in order. The trail can be viewed to be generated as follows:\\n    initially, before GL-bot performs any movement, the trail\\n    contains one element: the initial location of GL-bot. Whenever\\n    GL-bot moves into a different cell, the new location of GL-bot\\n    is added to the trail. In particular, this implies that no two\\n    consecutive cells in the trail are the same — if the robot is\\n    unable to move in a particular direction because it was\\n    occupied by an impassable cell, the trail is not extended.\\nYou giggle giddily as you watch GL-bot move. For some\\n    program and for some grid configuration, GL-bot will never stop\\n    moving, no matter how long time has passed. It can be proven\\n    that in this case, the trail will eventually end up repeating a\\n    continuous subsequence of itself. But you…, you don’t see such\\n    a thing. What you see is a robot that moves perpetually, as if\\n    it is sapient. Your fascination with GL-bot leaves the\\n    scientific committee worried, as GL-bot is not actually sapient\\n    yet (it just needs a few more tweaks). Thus, they attempt to\\n    convince you by showing that the movement is simply follows a\\n    pattern. If the length of the trail of the robot is finite, you\\n    should output $1$.\\n    Otherwise, let $X$ be the\\n    smallest integer such that the suffix of the trail will be a\\n    repetition of a continuous subsequence of the trail of length\\n    exactly $X$. Find\\n    $X$.\\nInput\\nThe first line contains a non-negative integer $3 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 200$, denoting both the\\n    dimension of the field and the maximum possible length of\\n    GL-bot’s program.\\nThe next line contains a non-empty string of length at most\\n    $N$, consisting only of\\n    the characters <, >, ^, and\\n    v. This string denotes GL-bot’s\\n    program.\\nThereafter follows $N$\\n    lines, each consists of a string consisting of $N$ characters.

The\\n    robbers begin within the cell marked ‘B’,\\n    indicating the Bank of Denview.

       " 'cornhusker': 'Corn farmers need to do pre-harvest yield estimates to\\n    determine the approximate number of bushels of corn their farm\\n    will produce. They do this to determine if they have enough\\n    storage space (grain bins) to store the harvested crop or if\\n    they’ll have to store the corn elsewhere, like a co-op (which\\n    costs $$$). They also use these estimates when negotiating the\\n    future market prices of their corn. Estimates are typically\\n    done about a month or two before harvest. By this time, the\\n    ears have formed and the kernels on the ears are mostly\\n    developed (this makes counting the kernels easier).\\nAccording to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln,\\n    Nebraska Extension for Educators, the standard way to\\n    estimate corn yield is to calculate the number of bushels of\\n    corn per acre. To make the calculations easier, they use an\\n    area of 1/1000th of an acre, which, with 30” row spacing, is a\\n    section of one row about 17’5” long. Within that 17’5”, five\\n    ears are chosen at random. For each ear, the number of kernels\\n    are counted by multiplying the number of rows of kernels around\\n    by the number of kernels over the length of the ear. The totals\\n    for each of the five ears are added together and then divided\\n    by five to determine the average number of kernels per ear of\\n    corn. This number is then multiplied by the total number of\\n    ears of corn in the 17’5” section of row. This gives you the\\n    total number of kernels in 1/1000th of an acre. This number is\\n    then divided by the Kernel Weight Factor\\n    (KWF). The KWF is a function of how wet (or\\n    dry) the growing season is and is typically a value between 75\\n    (wet) and 95 (dry). The resulting quotient is the number of\\n    bushels/acre the farmer can expect to harvest.\\nFor example, suppose that the average number of kernels per\\n    ear is 512 (16 kernels around by 32 kernels lengthwise), and\\n    there are 25 ears in the 17’5” of row with a KWF of\\n    85. The farmer could then expect:\\n\\n$\\\\frac{25\\\\times 512}{85}\\\\ = \\\\ 150\\\\\\n      bushels$\\n\\nSince farmers are quite conservative in their estimates, all\\n    calculations are done as integers with no rounding.\\nInput\\nInput consists of two lines.

       " 'countingclauses': 'It’s time for the annual 3-SAT competition, where the\\n    contestants compete to answer as many instances of 3-SAT as\\n    possible within the time limit. 3-SAT is a classic NP-complete\\n    problem, where you are given a boolean formula in\\n    conjunctive normal form, in which we have a set of\\n    clauses each consisting of exactly three\\n    literals. Each literal refer either positively or\\n    negatively to a variable, which can be assigned a\\n    value of either True or False. The question is whether there exists an\\n    assignment to the variables such that every clause evaluates to\\n    True. No clause will contain\\n    duplicates of a literal (however it is possible that a clause\\n    contain both $\\\\neg x_ i$\\n    and $x_ i$).

As a result,\\n    students decide to use the app Shazam to figure out what songs\\n    to add to their playlists, but there seems to be a problem: the\\n    app can never figure out what the song is.\\nYou start up Shazam at some note of the song currently\\n    playing, at which point the app listens to $K$ notes and scavenges its database\\n    for a match (i.e. a song in the database containing the same\\n    sequence of $K$ notes\\n    somewhere in the song). If the end of the song is reached\\n    before Shazam has listened to $K$ notes, it will instead only match\\n    songs in the database that end with the\\n    same sequence it heard.

Source: \\n          Wikimedia Commons\\n\\n\\n\\nTheta likes to play a board game called Cowboy Checkers,\\n    also known under the name “Nine Men’s Morris.” This strategy\\n    board game, which dates at least to the Roman Empire, is played\\n    by two players on a grid with $24$ intersections, or points, as\\n    shown on the left in Figure\\xa01. Each player has nine pieces\\n    represented by white and black colors. During the initial phase\\n    of the game, players take turns placing pieces on the board at\\n    unoccupied intersections. Once all pieces have been placed,\\n    players take turns moving pieces. Pieces can be moved along the\\n    lines of the board from one intersection (or corner) to any\\n    connected open intersection (or corner).\\nThe goal of the game is to take one’s opponent’s pieces,\\n    which is accomplished by forming “mills,” which consist of\\n    three pieces that are either horizontally or vertically\\n    adjacent. For instance, Figure\\xa01 shows two mills: white\\n    has a mill consisting of the pieces on e3, e4, and\\n    e5, and black has a mill consisting\\n    of the pieces on f2, f4, and f6.\\nEach time a player forms a mill they can take one piece from\\n    their opponent. Thus, a desirable position, which almost always\\n    results in a win, is a “double mill”: in this position, the\\n    player whose turn it is can move one piece from one mill such\\n    that it closes (completes) another mill. In the next move, the\\n    player can move back, closing the first mill again and\\n    reopening the second. For instance, in Figure\\xa01, White has\\n    created a double mill: the move e3 to\\n    d3 would close a mill consisting of\\n    d1, d2, and\\n    d3 while simultaneously creating an\\n    open mill e4, e5.\\nTheta is pretty good at spotting double mills - can you\\n    write a program that does the same?\\nInput\\nThe input consists of a single test case.

Hashing is a\\n    well-known solution for the problem. The idea is to create a\\n    function $h:\\\\Sigma ^*\\\\rightarrow\\n    [0..n-1]$ from all strings to the integer range\\n    $0,1,..,n-1$, i.e. you\\n    describe a fast deterministic program which takes a string as\\n    input and outputs an integer between $0$ and $n-1$. Next you allocate an empty hash\\n    table $T$ of size\\n    $n$ and for each word\\n    $w$ in ${D}$, you set $T[h(w)]=w$. Thus, given a query\\n    string $q$, you only need\\n    to calculate $h(q)$ and\\n    see if $T[h(q)]$ equals\\n    $q$, to determine if\\n    $q$ is in the dictionary.\\n    Seems simple enough, but aren’t we forgetting something? Of\\n    course, what if two words in ${D}$ map to the same location in the\\n    table? This phenomenon, called collision, happens fairly often\\n    (remember the Birthday paradox: in a class of 24 pupils there\\n    is more than $50$% chance\\n    that two of them share birthday). On average you will only be\\n    able to put roughly $\\\\sqrt\\n    {n}$-sized dictionaries into the table without getting\\n    collisions, quite poor space usage!\\n\\n    A stronger variant is Cuckoo Hashing1. The\\n    idea is to use two hash functions $h_1$ and $h_2$. Thus each string maps to two\\n    positions in the table. A query string $q$ is now handled as follows: you\\n    compute both $h_1(q)$ and\\n    $h_2(q)$, and if\\n    $T[h_1(q)]=q$, or\\n$T[h_2(q)]=q$, you\\n    conclude that $q$ is in\\n    ${D}$. The name “Cuckoo\\n    Hashing” stems from the process of creating the table.\\n    Initially you have an empty table. You iterate over the words\\n    $d$ in ${D}$, and insert them one by one. If\\n    $T[h_1(d)]$ is free, you\\n    set $T[h_1(d)]=d$.\\n    Otherwise if $T[h_2(d)]$\\n    is free, you set $T[h_2(d)]=d$. If both are occupied\\n    however, just like the cuckoo with other birds’ eggs, you evict\\n    the word $r$ in\\n    $T[h_1(d)]$ and set\\n    $T[h_1(d)]=d$. Next you\\n    put $r$ back into the\\n    table in its alternative place (and if that entry was already\\n    occupied you evict that word and move it to its alternative\\n    place, and so on). Of course, we may end up in an infinite loop\\n    here, in which case we need to rebuild the table with other\\n    choices of hash functions.

The players are Harry Horizontal and\\n    Vicky Vertical. Initially, there is a single piece consisting\\n    of $B \\\\times D$ connected\\n    squares (the individual brownies).\\nAt each turn, a player chooses one of the remaining pieces\\n    and if possible, cuts it into two smaller pieces such that both\\n    pieces have integer breadth and depth. Harry may make only\\n    horizontal cuts, Vicky only vertical cuts. Pieces may not be\\n    rotated before or after a cut. If a player cannot cut any of\\n    the remaining pieces, that player loses.\\nLet’s consider some examples. The simplest game is  . In this case, neither Harry nor\\n    Vicky can make a move, so whoever starts loses. On the other\\n    hand,  is a win for Harry, no matter who\\n    starts.

For reasons of symmetry, Harry loses if he is\\n    made to start.\\nIntuition might tell us that Vicky should tend to win if the\\n    initial sheet is broader than it is deep (since such sheets\\n    yield more opportunities for vertical cuts), but consider\\n     . If Harry starts, his only\\n    possible move leaves Vicky with  ,  and a win. But if Vicky starts,\\n    any possible move leaves Harry with  ,  .

If Harry starts, he runs out of moves after his first\\n    cut. If Vicky starts, her best move is to cut in the center,\\n    leaving Harry with  ,  , which he loses because each\\n     game is lost by whoever moves\\n    first.\\nGiven the initial size of the sheet, and given who starts\\n    the game, write a program that computes if the starting player\\n    has a strategy to force a win!\\nInput\\nThe first line contains an integer $1 \\\\le N \\\\le 10$ denoting the number\\n    of test cases that follow.

The machine works by cutting off\\n    material from a workpiece that is initially in the shape of a\\n    rectangular cuboid. Each cut then slices through the workpiece\\n    along a plane and only keeps the material on one of the two\\n    sides of that plane. This means that the final shape of the\\n    workpiece is necessarily a convex polyhedron.\\nThe programming interface of Lewis’ machine is fairly\\n    particular. Instead of directly specifying the planes along\\n    which the piece should be cut, the user inputs a list of points\\n    and the machine then computes the cutting planes such that all\\n    the points belong to the final shape and the volume of the\\n    shape is minimal.

       " 'dancecircle': 'Children Dancing in a Ring by Hans Thoma\\n\\n\\nIt’s Halloween, and you’ve organized a bonfire and dance for\\n    the neighborhood children. The $n$ children have gathered into a ring\\n    to dance around the fire. Each child is wearing one of two fun\\n    yet spooky costumes: orange pumpkin, or black bat. Since it’s\\n    dark outside, you can only see a few children at a time, as\\n    they pass behind the bonfire. The children are not standing\\n    evenly so the number of children you can see at each time\\n    differs. In particular, numbering the children $0, 1, \\\\ldots , n-1$ clockwise around\\n    the dance circle, at any given time you can see child\\n    $i$ in the center of your\\n    view, as well as $l_ i$\\n    children before child $i$\\n    and $r_ i$ children after\\n    child $i$ around the\\n    circle (i.e., child $i-l_ i,\\n    \\\\ldots , i-1, i, i+1, \\\\ldots , i+r_ i$, where the\\n    indices are of course taken modulo $n$).\\nTo help pass the time while the children dance, you wonder\\n    to yourself: suppose you only knew, for each child $i$, whether an even or odd number of\\n    the $l_ i+r_ i+1$ children\\n    centered at child $i$ is\\n    wearing the orange pumpkin costume. Would you be able to\\n    uniquely reconstruct what costume each child is wearing?\\n    Clearly this is possible when $l_\\n    i=r_ i=0$. But what if $l_\\n    i$ and $r_ i$ are\\n    not always zero? Maybe there are multiple possible solutions,\\n    or none at all? You decide to investigate, later in the evening\\n    once you’re back at your computer.\\nInput\\nThe first line of the input consists of a single integer\\n    $n$, indicating that there\\n    are $n$ children in the\\n    ring $(1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 200\\\\,\\n    000)$. The following $n$ lines describe the children you\\n    can see at different times. The $i$th line (indexed starting from\\n    zero) contains three space-separated non-negative integers\\n    $l_ i$, $r_ i$, $x_ i$ ($l_ i+r_ i+1\\\\leq n,0\\\\leq x_ i\\\\leq 1$):\\n    you can see $l_ i+r_ i+1$\\n    children when child $i$ is\\n    in the center of view ($l_\\n    i$ to the left and $r_\\n    i$ to the right of child $i$). If $x_ i=0$ then an even number of them\\n    are wearing the orange pumpkin costume. If $x_ i=1$ then an odd number of them\\n    are wearing the orange pumpkin costume.\\nOutput\\nCompute the number of ways of assigning a costume to each\\n    child, consistent with your observations. Since this number\\n    might be large, print the result modulo $10^9 + 7$.

As it turns out, Mittens traded a lot in\\n    the stock of her namesake mitten-producing company Mittens\\n    Conglomerated.\\n\\n    In Taxmania dead cats are prohibited from owning stock, so\\n    when Mittens died, all her shares (units) of stock in Mittens\\n    Conglomerated were sold, with $30\\\\% $ of the capital gains paid as\\n    taxes. Your task is to compute how much money the final sale of\\n    Mittens’ shares yields, after paying taxes on the profits.\\n    There are no tax effects from selling at a loss.\\nMittens stock records indicate the history of her\\n    purchases and sales of shares, and at what\\n    costs they were made. In addition, they indicate when the\\n    company performed splits and merges of its\\n    stock. When the company splits its stock, every share\\n    is replaced by $x$ new\\n    shares, and the value divided evenly between them. When the\\n    company merges its stock, every $x$ shares are replaced by a single\\n    stock. If Mittens can not merge all her shares (due to her\\n    number of shares not being divisible by $x$), she is forced to sell any\\n    remainder stock (at a price equal to the current average cost\\n    of her shares).\\nFor example, consider the following sequence of events\\n    (corresponding to Sample Input 2):\\n\\n\\nMittens buys $10$ shares for $10$ crowns per share.\\n\\n\\nMittens buys $30$ shares for $5$ crowns per share.

All of the goods and\\n    delivery trucks are initially located at your warehouse.\\n\\n    The road network consists of one-way streets between\\n    junctions. The warehouse and clients are all located at a\\n    junction. You know the driving time across each street.\\nYou guarantee extremely fast shipping: the trucks start\\n    driving immediately at the start of the day and each client\\n    $i$ will receive the\\n    package at time $T_ i$\\n    where $T_ i$ is the\\n    shortest possible driving time for a truck to go from the\\n    warehouse to the location of the client $i$.\\nWhat is the minimum number of trucks you have to deploy to\\n    ensure this guarantee is met? That is, what is the minimum\\n    number of trucks such that it is possible to give each truck a\\n    driving route so that every client $i$ is visited by some truck at time\\n    $T_ i$. Assume it takes no\\n    time to load the trucks with the appropriate goods at the start\\n    of the day, and it takes no time to drop goods off at a client\\n    once the truck arrives at the client. These goods are small\\n    enough that each truck can carry goods for as many clients as\\n    necessary.\\nInput\\nThe input consists of a single test case. The first line of\\n    each test case consists of three numbers $N$, $M$, and $C$. Here $N$ denotes the number of junctions in\\n    the road network ($2 \\\\leq N \\\\leq\\n    10^3$), $M$ denotes\\n    the number of streets ($1 \\\\leq M\\n    \\\\leq 10^5$), and $C$ denotes the number of clients\\n    ($1 \\\\leq C \\\\leq 300$,\\n    $C < N$).\\nThe junctions are numbered $0$ to $N-1$.

After months of playing a campaign in the\\n    table-top role-playing game Bungalows & Banshees, your\\n    character accidentally triggered a trap and was squished under\\n    a gigantic rolling boulder. If you had only succeeded in that\\n    dexterity saving throw to dodge out of the way of the incoming\\n    boulder of doom...\\n    Always one to dwell on the past, you begin to wonder what\\n    your chances actually were of succeeding with the saving throw,\\n    and discover that it is not immediately obvious – you had that\\n    bardic inspiration giving you a d6 bonus, but then you had\\n    disadvantage on the roll due to being intoxicated, but on the\\n    other hand your dexterity save modifier was pretty high...\\nA basic dexterity saving throw with difficulty $d$ is performed in the following way:\\n    first, a d$20$\\n    (i.e.,\\xa0a $20$-sided\\n    die) is rolled. If the result of the roll is $1$ the result is immediate failure,\\n    and if the result is $20$\\n    the result is immediate success.

If the sum is at least the difficulty\\n    $d$, the result is a\\n    success, otherwise it is a failure.\\nThere are two extensions to this. First, a roll may be made\\n    with either advantage or disadvantage. In these cases, two\\n    d$20$s are rolled instead\\n    of one, but then only the highest (for advantage) or lowest\\n    (for disadvantage) is kept and the result is then computed as\\n    in the basic case. Second, the roll may have additional bonuses\\n    or penalty in the form of additional dice that are rolled and\\n    then added to or subtracted from the d20 result before\\n    comparing it to $d$ (but\\n    these bonuses/penalties are only rolled once regardless of\\n    advantage or disadvantage).\\nWrite a program which, given the data of a saving throw (its\\n    difficulty, the DEX save modifier, advantage/disadvantage\\n    status, and additional bonus dice) computes the probability\\n    that the saving throw will succeed.\\nInput\\nThe input consists of three lines.

Finally, the third line starts\\n    with an integer $k$\\n    ($0 \\\\le k \\\\le 5$)\\n    indicating the number of additional bonus/penalty dice.

Wine lovers from all over the world come here to\\n    enjoy this sweet wine where it is made. The International\\n    Consortium of Port Connoisseurs (ICPC) is organizing tours to\\n    the vineyards that are upstream on the Douro River. To make\\n    visits more pleasurable for tourists, the ICPC has recently\\n    installed sun tarps above the vineyards. The tarps protect\\n    tourists from sunburn when strolling among the vines and\\n    sipping on a vintage port.\\nUnfortunately, there is a small problem with the tarps.\\n    Grapes need sunlight and water to grow. While the tarps let\\n    through enough sunlight, they are entirely waterproof. This\\n    means that rainwater might not reach the vineyards below. If\\n    nothing is done, this year’s wine harvest is in peril!\\nThe ICPC wants to solve their problem by puncturing the\\n    tarps so that they let rainwater through to the vineyards\\n    below. Since there is little time to waste before the rainy\\n    season starts, the ICPC wants to make the minimum number of\\n    punctures that achieve this goal.\\nWe will consider a two-dimensional version of this problem.\\n    The vineyard to be watered is an interval on the $x$-axis, and the tarps are modeled as\\n    line segments above the $x$-axis. The tarps are slanted, that\\n    is, not parallel to the $x$- or $y$-axes (see Figure\\xa01 for an\\n    example). Rain falls straight down from infinitely high. When\\n    any rain falls on a tarp, it flows toward the tarp’s lower end\\n    and falls off from there, unless there is a puncture between\\n    the place where the rain falls and the tarp’s lower end—in\\n    which case the rain will fall through the puncture instead.\\n    After the rain falls off a tarp, it continues to fall\\n    vertically.

A lesser known fact is\\n    that Julius Caesar had a grandfather named Julius Senior, an\\n    old man who has miraculously lived to this day and who\\n    currently resides in an old age home in the town of\\n    Quackville.\\nLife in the old age home is mostly dull, but every Friday,\\n    Julius Senior and his compatriots have a rousing game of Bingo!\\n    The stakes are especially high, for not only does the victor\\n    gain the much-coveted title of “Bingo Champion”, but there is\\n    also a reward of several sour candies. Julius Senior finds\\n    Bingo fun, but after never having won even once over all these\\n    millennia, the militaristic tendencies present in his family\\n    have begun to manifest themselves, and he has hatched a plot to\\n    gain the sour candies by illegitimate means. For his plan, he\\n    will need to make use of some divisibility hacks.\\nA divisibility hack is a mental math trick that can be used\\n    to easily decide which positive integers $n$ are multiples of a given positive\\n    integer $d$. As well as\\n    depending on the divisor $d$, a specific divisibility hack is\\n    determined by two other integer parameters, $b > 1$ and $m > 0$. The parameters\\n    $b$ and $m$ are used to define a reduction\\n    function $f_{b,m}(n)$ that\\n    maps positive integers to (usually smaller) integers. For a\\n    given positive integer $n$, if\\\\[ n = a_ kb^ k + a_{k - 1}b^{k - 1} + \\\\ldots\\n    + a_1b^1 + a_0b^0 \\\\]\\nis the base-$b$ expansion of $n$, then $f_{b,m}(n)$ is defined to\\n    be\\\\begin{align*} & +\\n    (a_{m - 1} b^{m - 1} + a_{m - 2} b^{m - 2} + \\\\ldots + a_1 b^1 +\\n    a_0 b^0)\\\\\\\\ & \\\\quad - (a_{2m - 1} b^{m - 1} + a_{2m - 2}\\n    b^{m - 2} + \\\\ldots + a_{m+1} b^1 + a_ m b^0)\\\\\\\\ & \\\\quad\\n    \\\\quad + (a_{3m-1} b^{m - 1} + a_{3m-2} b^{m - 2} + \\\\ldots +\\n    a_{2m+1} b^1 + a_{2m} b^0) \\\\\\\\ & \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad -\\n    (a_{4m-1} b^{m - 1} + a_{4m-2} b^{m - 2} + \\\\ldots + a_{3m+1}\\n    b^1 + a_{3m} b^0) \\\\\\\\ & \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad\\n    \\\\quad \\\\vdots \\\\end{align*}\\nwhere $a_ j = 0$\\n    whenever $j > k$. In\\n    other words, the reduction function is an alternating sum of\\n    terms, each of which is formed using $m$ consecutive base-$b$ digits of $n$, starting with the least\\n    significant digit. We say that the $(b,d,m)$ divisibility hack is\\n    valid if for all positive integers $n$, $f_{b,m}(n)$ is divisible by\\n    $d$ if and only if\\n    $n$ is divisible by\\n    $d$. Thus, if we have a\\n    large integer\\xa0$n$ to\\n    check for divisibility by\\xa0$d$, we can simply apply the reduction\\n    function to get a new smaller integer that we can instead test\\n    for divisibility by\\xa0$d$.\\nFor example, it turns out that $(10,11,1)$ is a valid divisibility\\n    hack. We can therefore determine that $123\\\\, 456\\\\, 789$ is not a multiple of\\n    $11$, since $9 - 8 + 7 - 6 + 5 - 4 + 3 - 2 + 1 =\\n    5$ is not a multiple of $11$. Also, $(10,7,3)$ is a valid divisibility\\n    hack, so we can use this to see that $42\\\\, 321\\\\, 999\\\\, 020$ is a multiple\\n    of $7$, since $20 - 999 + 321 - 42 = -700$ is a\\n    multiple of $7$.\\nJulius Senior’s nefarious scheme is to disseminate knowledge\\n    of some specific divisibility hacks to a select group of senior\\n    citizens, and to train them to go rabid when he says the\\n    trigger word “MAPS” (Multiples Are Pretty Sick), using their\\n    divisibility hacks to scream facts about integers dividing or\\n    not dividing other integers at each other. His plan is to do\\n    this in the middle of their next Bingo tournament, whereupon he\\n    can take advantage of the ensuing chaos to purloin the sour\\n    candies without anyone noticing.\\nUnfortunately, Julius Senior’s math skills aren’t what they\\n    used to be, so he is having a hard time coming up with\\n    divisibility hacks. In fact, when he randomly chooses integers\\n    $b$ and $d$, he can’t even figure out if there\\n    exists a positive integer $m$ such that the $(b,d,m)$ divisibility hack is valid.\\n    Can you write a program to help him determine when this is the\\n    case?\\nInput\\nThe input consists of two space-separated integers,\\n    $b$ and $d$, satisfying the bounds\\n    $1 < b,d < 2^{63}$.\\n    It is guaranteed that $d$\\n    is a prime number.\\nOutput\\nIf there exists a positive integer $m$ such that the $(b,d,m)$ divisibility hack is valid,\\n    output “yes”.

Note that in this problem, you can ignore the part from\\nthe 2048 puzzle where it introduces a new random tile with a\\nvalue of either 2 or 4 in an empty spot of the board at the\\nstart of a new turn.\\n\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n  Sample Output 1\\n\\n\\n2 0 0 2\\n4 16 8 2\\n2 64 32 4\\n1024 1024 64 0\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n4 0 0 0\\n4 16 8 2\\n2 64 32 4\\n2048 64 0 0\\n\\n\\nSample Input 2\\nSample Output 2\\n\\n\\n\\n2 0 0 2\\n4 16 8 2\\n2 64 32 4\\n1024 1024 64 0\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n2 16 8 4\\n4 64 32 4\\n2 1024 64 0\\n1024 0 0 0\\n\\n\\nSample Input 3\\nSample Output 3\\n\\n\\n\\n2 0 0 2\\n4 16 8 2\\n2 64 32 4\\n1024 1024 64 0\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n0 0 0 4\\n4 16 8 2\\n2 64 32 4\\n0 0 2048 64\\n\\n\\nSample Input 4\\nSample Output 4\\n\\n\\n\\n2 0 0 2\\n4 16 8 2\\n2 64 32 4\\n1024 1024 64 0\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n2 0 0 0\\n4 16 8 0\\n2 64 32 4\\n1024 1024 64 4\\n\\n\\nSample Input 5\\nSample Output 5\\n\\n\\n\\n2 2 4 8\\n4 0 4 4\\n16 16 16 16\\n32 16 16 32\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n4 4 8 0\\n8 4 0 0\\n32 32 0 0\\n32 32 32 0\\n\\n\\nSample Input 6\\nSample Output 6\\n\\n\\n\\n2 2 4 8\\n4 0 4 4\\n16 16 16 16\\n32 16 16 32\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n0 4 4 8\\n0 0 4 8\\n0 0 32 32\\n0 32 32 32\\n\\n'"

       "'Alan works for a company specialising in computer security.\\n    He recently came up with what he thinks is a great public key\\n    cryptosystem, in which the private key consists of two\\n    permutations $\\\\pi $ and\\n    $\\\\sigma $ of $\\\\{ 1, \\\\dots , n\\\\} $. The public key\\n    $(a_1, \\\\dots , a_ n)$ is\\n    then given by $a_ i \\\\equiv \\\\pi _\\n    i + \\\\sigma _ i \\\\pmod{n}$ for $1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$. The expression\\n    $x \\\\equiv y \\\\pmod n$ means\\n    that $x$ and $y$ have the same remainder after\\n    division by $n$.\\nAs an example with $n =\\n    5$, consider\\\\begin{align*} \\\\pi & = (3,1,5,2,4), \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\sigma & = (5,1,3,4,2), \\\\text {and} \\\\\\\\ a & =\\n    (3,2,3,1,1). \\\\end{align*}\\nHere, for example, $a_5 \\\\equiv\\n    1 \\\\equiv 4 + 2 \\\\equiv \\\\pi _5 + \\\\sigma _5 \\\\pmod{5}$, and\\n    all the entries in $\\\\pi $\\n    and $\\\\sigma $ respectively\\n    are $\\\\{ 1, \\\\dots , 5\\\\} $,\\n    each number occurring exactly once.\\nAlan’s coworkers have some doubts about this system being\\n    secure, since finding any private key corresponding to the\\n    public key would break the system. Your task is to help them\\n    out. Given $n$ and a\\n    sequence $a = (a_1, \\\\dots , a_\\n    n)$, determine whether there are two permutations\\n    $\\\\pi $ and $\\\\sigma $ such that $\\\\pi _ i + \\\\sigma _ i = a_ i \\\\pmod{n}$\\n    for each $i$. If there are\\n    more such pairs, print any of them.\\nInput\\nThe first line contains the length $n$ of the sequence and the\\n    permutation is written. The second line contains integers\\n    $a_1, \\\\dots , a_ n$,\\n    satisfying $1 \\\\leq a_ i \\\\leq\\n    n$. The length $n$\\n    satisfies $1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq\\n    1000$.\\nOutput\\nIf there is no solution, output “impossible”. If there is a solution, output any\\n    of them, writing the two permutations on one line each.\\n\\n\\nSample Input 1\\nSample Output 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n3 2 3 1 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1 4 3 5 2 \\n2 3 5 1 4 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Input 2\\nSample Output 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n3 1 1 4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nimpossible'"
